Eating is a part of daily life. A growing body of evidence supports the use of nutrition as therapy in health promotion, disease prevention, and disease treatment. We know that nutrition therapy can provide effective and efficient treatment when the medical condition affects nutritional needs or the diet affects the medical condition. When nutritional considerations are part of the plan of care, the health-care provider helps patients feel better; improves management of their health-care problems; and avoids complications that affect quality of life, productivity, and health-care costs. This chapter examines the role nutrition plays in pharmacotherapy, including the role of food intake on drug pharmacokinetics and the use of nutraceuticals (foods claimed to have a medicinal effect).

## NUTRIENT-DRUG INTERACTIONS
Drugs do not create new bodily functions but rather interact with cellular function. The supply of needed nutrients is key to adequate cell function. Because drugs are designed to improve altered cell function, it seems logical to conclude that nutritional factors can, in turn, affect pharmacological therapy. Clinically, health-care providers are concerned about the effect of drugs on the absorption, transport, metabolism, cellular uptake, and excretion of nutrients and the effect of nutrients on the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Additionally, some foods contain chemicals that may directly compete with medications; for example, foods high in vitamin K compete with warfarin. Therefore, drug-nutrient interactions must be considered to use drugs effectively in preventing and treating disease. Patients must be educated about drug-food interactions, especially if there is potential for adverse patient outcomes.

### Influence of Diet on the Pharmacokinetics of Drugs
#### Drug Absorption
The most frequent type of drug-food interaction is the effect that food has on the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of drugs. Drug absorption can be decreased, delayed, accelerated, or increased by food (Sharma & Prasad, 2021). Drug absorption takes place across the mucosa of the GI tract. The proximal part of the small intestine plays a significant role in drug and nutrient absorption, secondary to its large surface area, Drugs utilize the same transport mechanisms as nutrients: passive and facilitated diffusion, endocytosis, and active transport.

Several physiological factors affect drug absorption during the transport process: bioavailability (the percentage of drug available to produce a
pharmacological effect), presystemic metabolism, gastric emptying time, concentration gradient, and absorptive surface area. Food in the GI tract at the time of drug administration affects absorption and bioavailability of the drug by changing the gastric emptying time through interaction within the GI lumen and by competitive inhibition.

The absorption of drugs can be increased or decreased, depending on the presence of food (Sharma & Prasad, 2021; Willemsen et al, 2016). Food decreases the amount of fluid in the GI tract, thus slowing down drug dissolution. Lack of food for an extended period-fasting for a day, for example-can decrease absorption secondary to vasoconstriction. Gastric emptying time (GET) also can influence drug absorption. However, the effect varies depending on the type of drug preparation, disease states, age, and the need for presystemic metabolism or dissolution. Diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn, and celiac disease, and factors such as bariatric surgery may affect GET (Sharma & Prasad, 2021). Likewise, infants, children, and pregnant women have delayed GET. A drug that requires interaction in the stomach for disintegration and dissolution would have reduced absorption because of the rapid GET that might accompany a fasting state. Conversely, delayed GET that might occur with a high-fat meal would facilitate drug absorption because the drug is given more time for maximal disintegration and dissolution. Clearly, a change in GET can affect drug absorption, but the impact of the change is related to the dosage form and dissolution characteristics of the drug. A change in the drug form or time of administration can potentially affect bioavailability. If a patient has had a change in the effectiveness of a pharmacological therapy, asking the patient questions about food intake can be an important part of the clinical decision-making process.

In addition, the effect of food on the pH of the stomach can change bioavailability. The degree of ionization that occurs when a drug is taken into the stomach is a function of the stomach's pH. If a drug is a weak acid that is best absorbed in the nonprotonated (nonionized) state, then the low pH of the stomach is essential to drug absorption to allow the acid to remain nonionized and absorbable.

Chemical and physical changes in the drug can also occur as a result of interaction with food, which affect the absorption of the drug. Some examples of these effects are as follows:
- The provider needs to advise patients to take tetracycline on an empty stomach or with foods that are not high in calcium, aluminum, iron, or magnesium
because the drug chelates with these minerals, thereby decreasing absorption.
- Phenytoin binds with enteral nutrition products, which results in fluctuation of phenytoin levels. This has provided the impetus for the development of
protocols to stop enteral nutrition before, during, and after delivery of this medication when the patient is fed via tube.
- The bisphosphonate alendronate (Fosamax) demonstrates a 40% decrease in bioavailability when taken with food and a 60% decrease in bioavailability
when administered with coffee or orange juice, and therefore is taken only with water.
 - The effect of food on absorption of new targeted oral cancer therapies varies from none to significant; therefore, the manufacturer's directions should be
followed regarding whether to administer with food or on an empty stomach (Willemsen et al, 2016).

Additional physiological factors that may change a drug's absorption from the GI tract include food-induced changes in splanchnic blood flow. As pointed out earlier, use of the same cellular transport proteins could result in competition for transport systems. A high-protein diet is thought to reduce levodopa absorption because of competition for the same transport system.

The potential for change in drug absorption by food or nutrients in the GI system is high. Drugs that have decreased absorption with food may need to be administered on an empty stomach, unless that is the desired effect, as when griseofulvin is given with a high-fat meal. When food has no effect on drug bioavailability, then the drug may be administered without regard to food intake. Patient education regarding the coordination of medication administration and food intake should be integral to the prescribing process.

#### Drug Metabolism
The rate of drug metabolism in both the GI tract and the liver is affected by nutrient intake. A low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet may increase drug. metabolizing enzymes. Increasing intake of antioxidant cruciferous vegetables may also increase the activity of these enzymes. Clinically, we see examples of the effect of foods on metabolism daily, as unexplained variability in drug response or therapeutic drug levels.

The cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system is the major enzyme group responsible for the metabolism of foreign chemicals that come into the body. Information is expanding about the clinically significant interactions among nutrients and drugs utilizing the CYP450 enzyme system. In addition, the CYP450 system has a significant amount of polymorphism associated with it; that is, there are differences between individuals in the presence and/or function of a particular enzyme group. These differences reinforce the need to understand the nutrient effect on metabolizing enzymes. A more detailed discussion of the CYP450 system is provided in *Chapter 6*, including the genetic issues surrounding this system.

**Grapefruit Juice and CYP3A4**
Grapefruit, Seville orange, and pomelo juice influence the metabolism of many drugs because they contain components that inhibit CYP3A4. Studies have determined that the furanocoumarins in grapefruit juice have been identified as CYP3A4 inhibitors, decreasing the first-pass metabolism of drugs (Gertz et al, 2008; Mertens-Talcott et al, 2006; Mouly et al, 2017). Ingestion of grapefruit, Seville orange, or pomelo juice leads to increased levels and adverse effects of calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus), anti-infective agents (erythromycin, primaquine, halofantrine, maraviroc, rilpivirine, quinine), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, nilotinib, crizotinib, vemurafenib), some benzodiazepines (triazolam, midazolam), and the statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin; Kuypers, 2009; Mouly et al, 2017; Vaquero et al, 2010). Grapefruit juice increases the systemic exposure of oxycodone 1.7-fold (Mouly et al, 2017). The maximum inhibitory effect occurs if the grapefruit juice is ingested at the same time or within 4 hours of a drug (Gertz et al, 2008).

**Foods and CYPIA2**
Other foods and beverages that influence drug oxidation or conjugation reactions include indolic compounds in vegetables (cruciferous), methylxanthine- containing beverages (caffeine), and charcoal broiling. Cruciferous vegetables (including broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower) induce CYP1A2, an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including theophylline. Patients who consume large amounts of cruciferous vegetables may have therapeutic failure if they are being treated with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (Peterson et al, 2009). Apiaceous vegetables (carrots, parsnips, celery, or parsley family) inhibit CYP1A2 activity (Peterson et al, 2006). Tobacco smoking and charcoal-broiled meat induce CYP1A2 due to their high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Larsen & Brosen, 2005). Patients will need to be educated regarding intake of foods that induce CYP1A2 if they are on a medication with a narrow therapeutic index, such as theophylline.

#### Drug Excretion
Certain foods can change urinary pH, which then increases or decreases the amount of the ionized form of a drug or metabolite. The half-life of some medications may be changed by altering urine pH (Ishmail, 2009). For example, gentamicin as a basic drug would be more likely to be reabsorbed in the renal tubule when there is an alkaline pH. Foods that alkalinize the urine include milk, vegetables, and citrus fruits. Foods that acidify the urine include meat, fish, cheese, and eggs (Ishmail, 2009).

### Drug-Induced Nutrient Depletion
Another mechanism of interaction between drugs and nutrients is the effect drugs can have on nutrient absorption, synthesis, transport, storage, metabolism, and excretion. The side-effect profile of a drug taken over a period of time can be related to the effect of that drug on nutrient depletion. The number of potential drug-induced nutrient deficiencies is large and growing, and research in this area continues.

The mechanisms of action for drug-induced nutrient deficiencies are varied. As discussed previously, the GI changes due to dietary factors that affect drug absorption can also be induced by drugs and thus affect nutrient absorption. The alterations in GET, changes in pH, mucosal irritation (enteropathy), and formation of complexes that can result from drug therapy often have an impact on nutrient absorption. For example, changes in the pH from antacid or potassium therapy can reduce absorption of folic acid, iron, and vitamin B12. Drugs can induce or inhibit metabolic processes and, as a result, affect nutrient metabolism and bioavailability. For example, phenytoin reduces the level of folic acid by inhibiting intestinal enzymes needed for folic acid absorption. Many metabolic pathways rely on specific nutrient availability; therefore, a deficiency results in cellular dysfunction. For example, the synthesis of vitamins, coagulation factors, and neurotransmitters can be affected by reduction in nutrient substrates.

Just as nutrients can affect excretion of drugs, drugs can affect urinary secretion, reabsorption, and elimination of nutrients. For example, the commonly seen depletion of sodium, calcium, and potassium with loop diuretic use is the result of interference with renal reabsorption. Thus, drug-induced nutrient malabsorption, maldigestion, and vitamin antagonism are potential adverse reactions to commonly prescribed drugs.

### Outcomes of Nutrient-Drug Interactions
The physiological and cellular basis for nutrient-drug interactions is strong; however, it is the outcome of the interaction that takes the spotlight. Does the interaction cause a change in the expected outcome of drug therapy or a nutrient deficiency that enhances the potential for adverse reactions or disease progression? Clinically, practitioners often overlook this area. If the expected outcome of drug therapy is not occurring or the adverse reaction profile is enhanced, the practitioner must know the key questions to ask to determine what is happening. It should be clear that a piece of the data needed is related to food and nutrient intake. Could the patient who became pregnant on the low-estrogen birth control pill have a reduction in drug bioavailability due to food intake? Is an antidepressant not working secondary to high caffeine intake? Is the digoxin (Lanoxin) serum level low because of an aggressive bowel care program with high-fiber intake? And even more important, did the change in dietary fiber intake contribute to the digoxin toxicity the patient is experiencing?

An example of a food-drug interaction is one that occurs between warfarin and foods containing vitamin K. Patients who are taking warfarin should not ingest foods high in vitamin K because the combination may lead to therapeutic failure. Patients taking warfarin need to be educated regarding the vitamin K content of foods (**Table 7-1**). Warfarin and vitamin K interactions are further discussed in **Chapter 15**.

A high intake of foods containing tyramine can result in enhanced norepinephrine synthesis, which can be problematic if the same patient is taking drugs that increase norepinephrine availability at the neurological synapse. For example, the adverse effect of acute hypertension associated with the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is enhanced by intake of foods high in tyramine. The inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase by metronidazole results in a disulfiram- like reaction-flushing, headache, nausea, and abdominal or chest pain-when it is taken with alcohol or alcohol-containing products because of alteration in the metabolism of alcohol,

Food contains many highly interactive ingredients that can have an impact on drug therapy. For example, the use of caffeine, known for central nervous system (CNS) effects, is problematic for patients taking psychotropic medications. The ability to manage the mental health condition becomes a challenge when high or variable levels of caffeine are consumed. Sorbitol, a common ingredient in sugar-free foods, has a significant effect on GI transit time and thus can influence the absorption of both drugs and nutrients.

Alcohol consumption is also associated with significant drug interaction problems. Alcohol can either induce or inhibit the CYP450 system enzymes, depending on the ingestion pattern. Chronic low levels cause enzymatic induction, whereas high binge intake or high chronic use, resulting in hepatic failure, inhibits the metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, the provider needs to know the patient's specific level of alcohol consumption to better understand the potential for interaction with drugs.

#### Clinical Decision Making
What can providers do to improve their skill in recognizing nutrient-drug interactions? The provider should consider the following:

1. Use up-to-date resources to evaluate the potential for drug-food interactions.
2. Seek out educational materials that can provide accurate and appropriate drug information to patients.
3. Consult with other practitioners, pharmacists, and registered dietitians to identify drug-nutrient interactions.
4. Get a complete patient profile in terms of drug, herb, and nutrient intake. Knowing all of the medications taken-prescribed, over-the-counter, herbal, vitamin, alcoholic, nutrient supplementation-is key to the identification of interaction potential.

> The advanced-practice nurse must understand how the medication is taken in relation to food and fluids. How stable is food intake in terms of the substances known to affect drug absorption, such as fiber, protein, and fat? Clearly communicate to the patient the best routine for medication administration. The nurse practitioner needs to ensure that they and the patient read warning labels for instructions about mixing with food, using with nutritional supplements, and taking with fluid.

## Nutritional Management
Consumers have shown increased interest in and awareness of the importance of nutrition and nutrients in staying healthy. An outcome of this knowledge is increased use of nutrient supplementation. Nutritional supplementation is the use of vitamins, minerals, or other dietary factors to support health and prevent or treat disease. There are approximately 80 essential nutrients that must be acquired in the diet to maintain health. Although nutritionists will explain that the interplay of these nutrients is significant to their role in the body, many still will recommend supplementation of specific nutrients or combinations of nutrients for individuals at risk. It is vital that providers base recommendations about how nutrients are integrated into the plan of care, but it is not uncommon that accomplishing goals by diet alone is difficult for some individuals. Therefore, the provider must become skilled in accurately advising patients about the benefits of nutraceuticals in maintaining health and preventing and treating disease. Individuals who might be on drug therapy that can induce nutrient deficiencies need specific recommendations about diet and nutrient supplementation to avoid the additional adverse drug reactions.

The information gathered during the patient interaction should include a complete or focused nutritional assessment. Data from the diet history, anthropometric measurement, physical examination, and laboratory findings are useful for pharmacological decision making. Team members such as a clinical pharmacist and a registered dietitian are especially important in the care of patients with complex medical problems or pharmacological treatment plans. Disease-specific nutritional therapy is beyond the scope of this chapter; the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND; formerly American Dietetic Association [ADA]) has developed medical nutrition therapy protocols for a variety of diagnoses ([https://www.eatright.org/professional-resources](https://www.eatright.org/professional-resources)) and the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) has developed clinical guidelines to reflect current, evidence-based approaches to the practice of nutrition support ([https://www.nutritioncare.org/Guidelines_and_Clinical_Resources/Clinical_Guidelines](https://www.nutritioncare.org/Guidelines_and_Clinical_Resources/Clinical_Guidelines)).

Although much of the research surrounding supplements has not been conclusive in terms of randomized clinical trials and is even sometimes contradictory, patients are not waiting for conclusive outcomes to begin use of nutritional supplementation. To partner with the patient who is interested in nutritional supplementation, advanced-practice nurses must have a clear understanding of the patient’s philosophy surrounding nutritional supplementation and the recommendations of experts in the area. The AND has developed a position statement about vitamin and mineral supplementation that provides a solid foundation for assisting patients with their nutrient supplementation considerations ([https://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/nutrient-supplementation](https://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/nutrient-supplementation)). The organization supports obtaining nutrients through a wide variety of foods as the best way to promote health and reduce risk of chronic disease (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2018).

However, the AND defines cases in their position statement the circumstances in which supplementation is indicated. The following are populations that may warrant supplementation (2018):

- Infants and children, including adolescents, need supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D daily.
- Exclusively breastfed full-term infants from age 4 months require 1 mg/kg daily iron supplementation until they begin eating complementary foods containing iron.
- Women of childbearing age who may become pregnant need 400 mcg/day of folic acid.
- Pregnant women need 600 mcg/day of folic acid, a multivitamin/mineral supplement, 27 mg/day of iron (60 mg/day if the patient is anemic), and vitamin B₁₂ if the patient is vegan or lacto-ovo vegetarian.
- Adults over age 50 need 2.4 mcg/day of vitamin B₁₂ and must ensure adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.
- Patients at risk for suboptimal vitamin D levels (older patients, patients with dark skin, patients who are not exposed to sufficient sunlight) should consume vitamin D–fortified foods and/or supplements.
- Patients with intermediate or advanced age-related macular degeneration need antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation.

These nutritional supplementation guidelines are included and the nurse practitioner must guide patients to understand their need. Most important in this interaction between patient and practitioner is an open, honest discussion of the nutritional supplementation decision. Although vitamin supplementation is common and unlikely to cause harm, the same cannot be said for many other nutrients for which there is no recommended daily allowance (RDA) and no established standard for supplementation. If you do recommend or prescribe a multiple vitamin and mineral supplement for an at-risk individual, it is important to frame the dosage needed around the RDA and recommended vitamin and mineral intake ranges.

## Nutraceuticals
As noted previously, nutraceuticals are foods believed to have a medicinal effect on health. Nutraceuticals may also be referred to as *functional foods*, but the terms are not interchangeable. Functional foods are foods that have health benefits, whereas nutraceuticals include dietary supplements (Baker et al., 2021; Crowe & Francis, 2013). There are five major categories of nutraceuticals used frequently in primary care: dietary fiber; vitamins and minerals; bioactive substances; fatty acids; and pre-, pro-, and synbiotics.

The list of nutraceuticals reviewed in this book is not exhaustive and is limited to those for which there are adequate safety and efficacy data to recommend use. The National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS; [https://ods.od.nih.gov](https://ods.od.nih.gov)) maintains a more expansive list of nutraceuticals with the current evidence. The ODS website contains extensive information for both providers and patients regarding nutraceuticals, including nutrient recommendations, a clinical trials database, and consumer safety information.

### Fiber
Fiber is the term used to describe the substances in plants that the body cannot digest. According to the Institute of Medicine (2005), there are two types of fiber: dietary fiber and functional fiber. Dietary fiber is the nondigestible carbohydrates and lignin parts of the plant that are intrinsic and intact, whereas functional fiber is the nondigestible carbohydrates that have beneficial effects in human beings. Total fiber is the sum of the two types. The adequate intake recommendation for fiber is based on the amount needed to decrease chronic disease and increase physiological function (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2015).

There are more than 7.95 million visits per year to providers for constipation (Shah et al., 2008). There have been controlled trials in children (Korczak, 2017) and patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (McRorie et al., 2020) that demonstrate a decrease in constipation with an increase of fiber in the diet. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends increasing fiber intake to prevent constipation (Wald, 2016).

Dietary fiber intake may also lower cholesterol, improve cardiovascular health, and provide a feeling of fullness that may aid in weight loss. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) demonstrated a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and lower C-reactive protein level with increased fiber intake (King et al., 2014). The American Heart Association (AHA) and the AND both recommend increased fiber intake (at least 25 g/day) for cardiovascular health (AHA, 2017; AND, 2015).

Increased soluble fiber intake has been associated with a number of additional benefits, including better glucose control and improved blood lipid levels in patients with diabetes (Alexandre & Miguel, 2008; Vuksan et al., 2009), decreased risk of kidney stones in postmenopausal women (Sorensen et al., 2014), and improved bowel function and health-related quality of life in patients with Crohn disease (Bertholon et al., 2014). Higher dietary fiber intake is associated with less lower gastrointestinal cancer risk in older male veterans (Schwartz et al., 2012). Evidence that dietary fiber decreases cancer risk is inconsistent. Recommended fiber intake is found in **Table 7-2**

### Vitamins and Minerals
Vitamins and minerals are the most widely used supplements. When ingested as part of food sources, vitamins may be considered nutraceuticals. Evidence regarding recommendations for specific vitamins and the proper dosage of vitamins and minerals is constantly evolving. The most commonly recommended vitamins are discussed in the following subsections and listed in **Table 7-2**. Iron is discussed in **Chapters 15 and 28**. More extensive information on vitamins and minerals can be found on the ODS website ([https://ods.od.nih.gov](https://ods.od.nih.gov)).

#### Vitamin A
Vitamin A plays a critical role in vision, bone growth, reproduction, immune function, and cell division and differentiation (ODS, 2022a). There are two types of vitamin A: preformed vitamin A, which is derived from animal sources, and provitamin A carotenoids, which is derived from plant sources. Vitamin A is stored in the liver and consumed in the diet. A healthy diet should contain a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables.

Vitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States, but deficiencies may be found in developing countries. Serum retinol and carotenoid levels are measured in plasma, which can be used to assess vitamin A deficiency, but does not measure the vitamin A stored in the liver (ODS, 2022a). Vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness, xerophthalmia, or decreased immune function. Vitamin A may reduce the severity and duration of diarrheal episodes in malnourished children in developing countries but not in well-nourished children (Imdad et al, 2011; ODS, 2022a). Vitamin A supplementation has also been found to decrease bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely low-birth-weight infants with no increase in mortality or neurodevelopmental disorder (Ambalavanan et al, 2005; Gadhia et al, 2014). Chronic alcoholism may lower vitamin A levels, and patients with chronic alcoholism may require supplementation, Patients with cystic fibrosis are predisposed to malabsorption and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, with 10% to 40% of patients with cystic fibrosis being deficient in Vitamin A and requiring supplementation (ODS, 2022a; Woestenenk et al, 2016).

Vitamin A supplementation is recommended for all children with measles, regardless of nutritional status. The dosing of vitamin A is 200,000 IU for children 12 months or older, 100,000 IU for infants 6 through 11 months of age, and 50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).

> Caution should be used to avoid excessive vitamin A supplementation (more than 1,500 mcg per day), as toxicity may occur (ODS, 2022a). Levels above recommended amounts may be teratogenic in pregnant women; preformed vitamin A is teratogenic if intake is greater than recommended amounts.

#### Vitamin B₁
Vitamin B₁ (thiamine) is a water-soluble vitamin critical for many body functions and is widely available in fortified breads and cereals. Early thiamine deficiency can lead to weight loss and anorexia, memory loss, and muscle weakness (ODS, 2022b). Chronic deficiency of thiamine can lead to beriberi (peripheral neuropathy and wasting) or Wernicke encephalopathy. Patients with alcoholism develop thiamine deficiency at 10 times the rate of the population without alcoholism (Agabio, 2005). Up to 80% of patients with chronic alcohol dependence will develop thiamine deficiency due to impaired gastrointestinal absorption of thiamine (ODS, 2022b). Risk factors for thiamine deficiency include older adults (20%–30%), persons with HIV/AIDS, persons with diabetes, and those who have had gastric bypass surgery. Wernicke encephalopathy is a serious neurological illness in patients with alcoholism and requires immediate high-dose levels of thiamine (500 mg/day IV or IM for 5 days). Patients should be given a daily 100 mg dose of oral thiamine until no longer considered at risk (Baines & So, 2009). Treatment for beriberi or severe thiamine deficiency in children is IV thiamine 25 to 50 mg followed by 10 mg IM daily for 1 week, and in adults 50 to 100 mg IM daily for 1 week, with both children and adults receiving 3 to 5 mg orally daily for an additional 6 weeks. Thiamine deficiency is treated by administering 10 mg thiamine orally per day for a week, followed by 3 to 5 mg per day for 6 weeks (ODS, 2022b).

#### Vitamin B₂
Vitamin B₂, also known as riboflavin, is a water-soluble vitamin. It is found in eggs, organ meats, lean meats, milk, and fortified breads and cereals (ODS, 2022c). Riboflavin deficiency is rare but may be seen in patients with alcoholism, anorexia, and those with lactose intolerance who cannot drink milk or consume other dairy products. Vegetarian athletes are at risk due to their increased need for riboflavin and their diet which excludes the best sources of the nutrient. Pregnant women who do not consume meat and fortified cereals are at risk (ODS, 2022c). Vegans or persons who consume little meat or milk are also at risk for deficiency. Riboflavin has been found to decrease headaches and migraines in some patients (Das & Quibby, 2021; ODS, 2022c). Migrelief, an over-the-counter product that contains riboflavin, magnesium, and coenzyme Q10, is used as a complementary headache medication. Doses of oral 25 to 400 mg of riboflavin daily are used for migraine prevention, which exceeds the safe intake of the water-soluble riboflavin.

#### Vitamin B₃
Vitamin B₃, or niacin, is a water-soluble vitamin and antilipidemic. Most Americans consume more than the RDA, although niacin deficiency or pellagra may result from inadequate intake, particularly in cases of extreme poverty or severely restricted diets that are low in protein. Serum levels of niacin are not an accurate measure of niacin deficiency; urinary excretion of the metabolites N¹-methyl-nicotinamide and N¹-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide measure niacin status (ODS, 2022d). Pellagra presents with a pigmented rash or brownish discoloration of the skin exposed to sunlight and may develop a sunburn-like appearance. Additional symptoms of pellagra include bright red tongue, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and neurological symptoms such as depression, apathy, and headaches. Loss of memory and hallucinations may occur. Pellagra may be fatal. Pellagra is treated with 100 mg niacin orally three times daily. Use of niacin in the treatment of hyperlipidemia is discussed in **Chapter 42**.

#### Vitamin B₆
Vitamin B₆, also known as pyridoxine, is a water-soluble vitamin needed for protein and red blood cell metabolism, as well as glucose regulation. Vitamin B₆ deficiency may lead to microcytic anemia, depression and confusion, dermatitis with cheilosis (scaling of the lips and cracks at the corners of the lips), and glossitis (ODS, 2022e). Vitamin B₆ deficiency may be induced by use of cycloserine, and some antiepileptic medications (valproic acid, carbamazepine, and phenytoin), or caused by a diet that is deficient in foods containing vitamin B₆ (fortified cereals, potatoes, bananas, meat). Patients with chronic renal disease, inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease), and alcohol dependence are also at risk of deficiency (ODS, 2022e). Pyridoxine (vitamin B₆) 25 to 50 mg/day orally should be added to the regimen for pregnant patients taking isoniazid (INH) to decrease the incidence of peripheral neuropathy associated with INH (Naldi et al., 2016). Pyridoxine (adults 100 mg/day or divided high doses) may also be prescribed prophylactically to patients with peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin B₆ supplements may reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, and nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy (10–25 mg tid; ODS, 2022e).

#### Vitamin B₁₂
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis, and neurological function. Vitamin B12 levels can be measured in the serum or plasma, and levels lower than 200 to 250 pg/mL indicate deficiency (ODS, 2022f). Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia, fatigue, weakness, glossitis of the tongue, constipation, and weight loss. There may be an association between vitamin B12 deficiency and depression. Older adults and patients with reduced stomach acid levels, gastric bypass surgery, or intestinal disorders (celiac disease or Crohn disease) may not absorb vitamin B12 well and are at risk for deficiency (ODS, 2022f). Strict vegetarians or vegans are at risk for developing deficiency. Also, breastfeeding women who follow strict vegan or vegetarian diets without supplementation place themselves and their breastfed infants at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to developmental delays or failure to thrive in the infant. Acid suppression medications (proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonists) and metformin reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (ODS, 2022f). Vitamin B12 deficiency is treated with vitamin B12 injections or very high dose (1,000 to 2,000 mcg) oral vitamin B12. A complete discussion of vitamin B12 replacement is found in **Chapter 28** under the discussion of anemia.

#### Vitamin C 
Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that humans do not have the ability to synthesize, so adequate amounts must be present in the diet. Patients with inadequate vitamin C intake may develop scurvy, with symptoms of fatigue, malaise, and gum inflammation or bleeding appearing when vitamin C levels fall below 0.2 mg/dL (Trapani et al, 2022). With worsening deficiency, patients may develop joint pain, ecchymosis purpura, poor wound healing, and corkscrew hairs (ODS, 2022g). Scurvy is rare in developed countries but may occur in cases of limited intake or limited food variety. Smokers and persons who are heavily exposed to secondary smoke have decreased vitamin C levels; therefore, it is recommended they take 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers (ODS, 2022g). Other groups at risk for vitamin C deficiency are infants fed evaporated milk or boiled milk without additional vitamin C supplementation, patients with malabsorption disorders, and patients with end-stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis (ODS, 2022g).
Vitamin C therapy has been studied for its effects on health because of its antioxidant and immune function actions. It has been touted as prevention or treatment for the common cold since the 1970s, when Linus Pauling published his landmark book, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. Many studies have been conducted and there is insufficient evidence that vitamin C reduces the common cold in the general population, though it may helpful in those with low vitamin C intake (ODS, 2022g)
The role of antioxidants in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer has been studied extensively, but because the results have been mixed, there is no strong recommendation for vitamin C supplementation beyond the recommended daily amounts as prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer (ODS, 2022g). *Table 7-3* lists the recommended vitamin C intake levels for all ages.

#### Vitamin D
Vitamin D, also known as calciferol, is a fat-soluble vitamin that is available in some foods, such as egg yolks and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). The body synthesizes vitamin D when sunlight strikes the skin and triggers vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D supplements, food sources, and the vitamin D synthesized from sunlight must be converted to an active form of drug in the liver and kidneys. The liver converts vitamin D into 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], or calcidiol. The kidneys convert vitamin D into 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or calcitriol. Vitamin D is required for absorption of calcium from the intestinal tract, and when converted to calcitriol, regulates serum calcium and phosphate levels. Therefore, vitamin D is a critical component in bone growth and remodeling. Vitamin D deficiency will lead to brittle bones that may become misshapen, a condition known as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults (ODS, 2022h). Vitamin D status is measured by 25(OH)D serum concentrations, but available assays to measure vitamin D are variable and results can be falsely high or low.
In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) increased the recommended vitamin D intake for infants and children due to repeated studies indicating children and adolescents are deficient in vitamin D (Golden et al, 2014). Breastfed infants require 400 IU of vitamin D per day, or a maternal intake of 6,000 IU per day to have adequate intake. Children ages 12 months through 18 years need 600 IU daily, with supplementation required if adequate amounts are not consumed from dietary sources (Golden et al, 2014). Studies find that up to 40% of U.S. infants are not receiving the recommended amount of vitamin D (Simon & Ahrens, 2020).
Multiple studies link low vitamin D levels to increased incidence of asthma in adults and children. The use of oral corticosteroids places the patient at 20% to 40% higher risk of vitamin D deficiency (Korn et al, 2013). Vitamin D is an immunomodulator, which alters the development of immune cells, reduces airway remodeling and the inflammatory response, improves eosinophil function, and inhibits fibrotic mediators (Poon et al, 2013; Rance, 2013). Vitamin D supplementation may also improve asthma symptoms, particularly if the patient is deficient.
Serum levels of 25(OH)D can be drawn to determine whether the patient is deficient in vitamin D. **Table 7-4** lists ranges of 25(OH)D associated with deficiency and toxicity. Vitamin D is added to milk, most milk substitutes, infant formula, and dry cereal and is available in supplements as either vitamin D2 or D3. The use of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of rickets, osteomalacia, and osteoporosis is discussed in depth in **Chapter 22**.
 
#### Vitamin K
Vitamin K, one of the fat-soluble vitamins, is a critical component of blood clotting, is found in many foods, and is synthesized by intestinal bacteria. There are two types of vitamin K: phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is the form in green leafy vegetables, and menaquinones (vitamin K2) predominantly of bacterial origin, is found in animal-based and fermented foods (ODS, 2022i). Vitamin K deficiency is rare beyond the newborn period, except in the presence of malabsorption disorders. Newborns are at risk for early vitamin K-deficiency bleeding because of poor transfer of vitamin K across the placenta, and the AAP has recommended that all newborns receive vitamin K since 1961, ideally within 6 hours of birth (AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn, 2022). The dose of vitamin K (phytonadione) recommended by the AAP is 1.0 mg IM for infants weighing more than 1500 grams and o.3 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg in preterm infants weighing less than 1,500 grams (AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn, 2022). Oral vitamin K is used in some countries and by some providers in the United States. The AAP (2022) notes that several countries use oral vitamin K, but multiple doses are required and there is still a risk of vitamin K-deficiency bleeding in newborns who received oral vitamin K. The AAP recommends IM vitamin K administration due to poor protection against bleeding observed with oral dosing.

**Warfarin** interferes with the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), leading to decreased formation of clots. Vitamin K (phytonadione) is prescribed for patients who develop critically high International Normalized Ratios (INRs) while on warfarin. Patients with an INR greater than 10 with no evidence of bleeding can be administered oral vitamin K (5–10 mg). If high INR with bleeding occurs, vitamin K (5–10 mg IV) is administered along with prothrombin complex (Guyatt et al, 2012).

#### Folate
Folate is a water-soluble vitamin critical to the production of nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) and metabolism of amino acids, and to maintenance of new cells. Folate is found in foods such as green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, and dried legumes. Folic acid, the synthetic form of folate, is added to breads, flours, pastas, rice, and other grain products (ODS, 2022i). Folate deficiency occurs in times of increased demand, such as in pregnancy and lactation, or when loss increases (malabsorption, alcohol abuse, dialysis, liver disease). Medications may interfere with folate utilization, leading to deficit (**Box 7–1**). Folic acid supplementation is recommended for all women of childbearing age (400 mcg/day), with extra given when a woman is pregnant (600 mcg/day) to prevent neural tube defects in the fetus (ODS, 2022i). Lactating women should take 500 mcg/day.
#### Box 7–1: Medications Interfering with Folate Utilization
- Antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate)  
- Metformin  
- Sulfasalazine  
- Triamterene  
- Methotrexate  
- Barbiturates  
- Trimethoprim  
- Pyrimethamine  
- Isoniazid  
- Oral contraceptives

Folate is necessary for the normal maturation and function of red blood cells. Folate deficiency produces a macrocytic-normochromic (megaloblastic) anemia. Patients with folic acid–deficiency anemia commonly complain of glossitis, stomatitis, nausea and anorexia, and diarrhea, and a systolic ejection murmur may be heard. Oral folic acid is well absorbed, and doses of 1 to 2 mg/day result in correction of the deficiency in 4 to 5 weeks. Hemoglobin (Hgb) levels begin to rise within the first week, and anemia is completely corrected in 1 to 2 months.

#### Calcium
Calcium is a critical mineral in the function of the body, required for muscle contraction, blood vessel health, bone health, and normal nerve conduction.Maintaining calcium balance involves a complex relationship between adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D and endocrine system function. When dietary intake decreases, calcium from bone is used to help maintain serum calcium levels (ODS, 2022k). Serum calcium levels measure approximately 1% of calcium in the skeleton, not total body stores, because 99% of calcium is in bone structures. Populations at risk for calcium deficiency include postmenopausal women, amenorrheic women, women with female athlete triad, patients with lactose intolerance, vegans, and those who avoid dairy products. In the 2007–2010 NHANES study, 49% of children age 4 to 18 years consumed inadequate amounts of calcium in their diet (Wallace et al, 2014). Likewise, 39% of all persons over age 4 years reported inadequate calcium intake (Wallace et al, 2014). Recommended daily amounts of calcium are found in **Table 7–3**.

Calcium absorption varies with the type of calcium consumed and the age of the person ingesting the supplement. The phytic acid and oxalic acid found in some plants decrease calcium absorption. Calcium absorption is high (60%) in infants and children but decreases with age to 15% to 20% in adults (ODS, 2022k). Calcium absorption is enhanced when the supplement is taken with food. The use of calcium to prevent osteoporosis is discussed in **Chapter 22**.
#### Iron
Iron is an essential mineral required for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and is a component of oxygen transport. Patients with iron deficiency will develop microcytic-hypochromic anemia and have blood cells that are small, pale, and low in hemoglobin. Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to fatigue and decreased immunity. Serum ferritin measures the body’s iron stores and a serum ferritin level of fewer than 30 ng/mL indicates iron deficiency, with levels less than 10 ng/mL seen in IDA (ODS, 2022l). Groups at risk for iron deficiency include those going through periods of rapid growth, including infants, toddlers, menstruating women, pregnant women, and female adolescents.  Other populations at risk for iron deficiency include women with heavy menstrual bleeding, frequent blood donors, and patients with cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, or bowel surgery (ODS, 2021l). Too much iron can lead to iron toxicity; therefore, patients should be advised to take only the recommended amount for their age and condition (see **Table 7–3**). The use of iron for the treatment of IDA is discussed in depth in **Chapter 28**.
### Fatty Acids
The fatty acids are also called **essential fatty acids**. Fatty acids need to be consumed in food or via supplements, as the body cannot make them.  
The polyunsaturated fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is ingested in the diet and is an omega-3 fatty acid. Linoleic acid (LA), also ingested from the diet, is an omega-6 fatty acid. Omega-3 is converted to the fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the body. Most Americans consume more omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids, although consuming more omega-3 than omega-6 is recommended.  
Dietary sources of ALA are nuts, vegetables oils, and leafy green vegetables, whereas LA is found in vegetable oils and meats.  
Sources of EPA and DHA are fish and organ meats (ODS, 2022m).

There have been many clinical trials examining the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.  
Two large recent trials are the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) and a study of Cardiovascular Inflammation Biomarkers in Diabetes (ASCEND) (Bowman et al, 2018; Manson et al, 2018; Manson et al, 2019).  
In the VITAL trial (N = 25,871), 5.3 years of omega-3 supplementation did not reduce combined major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac mortality), but the participants who were taking omega-3 supplements had a significant reduction (28%) in total myocardial infarction rates and fatal myocardial infarction (Bowman et al, 2018).  
In the ASCEND study, involving 15,480 adults with diabetes, omega-3 dietary oils or wider intakes, omega-3 supplementation did not reduce the risk of serious vascular event, but did reduce the risk of cardiovascular death by 19% compared with placebo (Manson et al, 2019).  
A meta-analysis of 71 trials examining the association between omega-3 fatty acids and blood pressure revealed a dose-related response, with reduced blood pressure at 2 g/day and 3 g/day (Zhang et al, 2022).

Omega-3 fatty acids have received attention as a possible treatment for autism and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  
The theory is that either deficiency in omega-3 or an imbalance in omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids affects neurocognitive development in children. It is clear that sufficient amounts of the essential fatty acids are critical to central nervous development, with deficiency or imbalance found in multiple observational studies of children with neurocognitive issues (Schuchardt et al, 2009). This has led to the addition of DHA and ALA commercial infant formulas to support the development of the need in the key developmental period of infancy. A comprehensive review of 95 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 48 prospective longitudinal studies of maternal intake of omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation, and infant formulas concluded there are no consistent health outcomes with supplementation (Newberry et al, 2016).

Numerous studies of the use of omega-3 fatty acids in children with ADHD demonstrate improvement in ADHD scores (Bloch & Qawasmi, 2011; Gillies et al, 2012; Schuchardt et al, 2009). A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of omega-3 supplementation on emotional lability, oppositional defiant behavior, and conduct problems in children with ADHD did not find large effects. However, the study did find small effects on emotional lability and oppositional defiant behavior in children with ADHD who are supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids (Cooper et al, 2016). With these findings and the understanding of the need for essential fatty acids in neurological development, it is critical to ensure a diet rich in essential fatty acids throughout infancy and childhood, with the trial of supplemental omega-3 fatty acids in children.

Not all health claims for essential fatty acids are supported by evidence. For example, there is no supportive evidence for the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer disease, dementia, or cognitive function; age-related macular degeneration; inflammatory bowel disease; and cancers including breast, colorectal, and prostate (ODS, 2022m). There was no reported improvement from the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in terms of patient reports of pain, swollen joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and patient global assessment, but use of omega-3 fatty acids does decrease use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids (ODS, 2022m).

Recommended amounts of omega-3 fatty acids can be ingested in the diet by eating fatty fish or by taking fish oil capsules. The AHA (2014) recommends two servings a week of fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, lake trout, sardines, or albacore tuna for heart health. The recommended amount of omega-3 fatty acid from fish is 500 mg/day if there is no history of coronary heart disease, 1 g per day if there is a documented history of coronary heart disease, and 2 to 4 g/day to lower triglycerides (AHA, 2014; Lee et al, 2008; Zhang et al, 2022). It may take 2 to 3 weeks for the effects of omega-3 to be seen. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI; 2012) guidelines for reducing cardiovascular risk in children and adolescents recommend increasing dietary fish intake to increase omega-3 fatty acid intake.

### Plant Sterols
Plant sterols are found in all plant-based foods as part of the structural components of the cell membrane (Ellegard et al, 2007). Plant sterols are similar in structure to cholesterol but contain an extra methyl or ethyl group. When consumed in the diet, plant sterols compete with cholesterol in the intestine, reducing the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed (Ras et al, 2014). Intake of 2 g per day of plant sterols has an associated 6% to 10% reduction in LDL cholesterol (Devaraj & Jialal, 2006; Ellegard et al, 2007; Gylling et al, 2014). Combining plant sterols with cholesterol-lowering medications results in an additional 16% to 20% reduction in LDL (Berger et al, 2004; Katan et al, 2003). The only adverse effect of plant sterols is reduced beta-carotene levels, which can be treated with an increased intake of carotene-containing fruits and vegetables (Berger et al, 2004; Devaraj & Jialal, 2006).

Plant sterols are present in edible oils (corn oil and canola oil have the highest amount), seeds, and nuts, as well as vegetables (broccoli and Brussels sprouts have high amounts), and fruits (blueberries, raspberries, and avocado have high amounts; Ellegard et al, 2007). There are many commercial food products available with added plant sterols, including margarine (Promise Active 1 g/serving, Benecol spread o.85 g/serving, Smart Balance HeartRight 1.7 g/serving), orange juice (Minute Maid Heart Wise 1 g/serving), and milk (Smart Balance HeartRight 400 mg/serving). The recommended amount of plant sterols for LDL reduction is up to 2 g/day (Devaraj & Jialal, 2006; Gylling et al, 2014). The NHLBI guideline for children and adolescents is that plant sterols up to 2 g/day can be used as a replacement for the usual fat sources after age 2 years in children with familial hypercholesterolemia (NHLBI, 2012). Plant sterols may be combined with a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet, dietary fiber, and/or lipid-lowering drugs for an additive effect on reducing LDL cholesterol (Devaraj & Jialal, 2006).

### Pre-, Pro-, and Synbiotics
Probiotics are nonpathogenic bacteria normally found in the intestinal microflora, the most common of which are Lactobacillus acidophilus and the Bifidobacterium species. Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate growth of probiotic organisms, and synbiotics are a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics are used to restore the normal balance of gut flora that is disturbed with antibiotics, immunosuppressive medications, and other conditions (Weichert et al, 2012; Williams, 2010). Probiotics are also thought to enhance the intestinal immune response, block the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to the intestinal epithelium, upregulate intestinal electrolyte absorption, and repair intestinal permeability (Wilkins & Sequoia, 2017).

Probiotics have been used for many years and have been studied extensively for their health benefits and their effects on diarrhea. Multiple systematic reviews of the use of probiotics in acute diarrhea in children found probiotics reduced diarrhea severity and duration by 1 to 3 days (Allen et al, 2004; Feizizadeh et al, 2014; Urbańska et al, 2016). Probiotics also reduce antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults (D'Souza et al, 2002; Safdar et al, 2008; Tong et al, 2006; ODS, 2022n) and in children (Goldenberg et al, 2015; Hempel et al, 2012; Johnston et al, 2007; ODS, 2022n). Multiple meta-analysis studies have demonstrated that probiotic administration reduced Clostridium difficile infections compared with placebo (Wilkins & Sequoia, 2017). It is reasonable to prescribe probiotics for patients with infectious or antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Patients should start probiotics on the first day of antibiotic therapy or at onset of acute diarrheal symptoms, and continue for 1 to 2 weeks after antibiotics are completed (Wilkins & Sequoia, 2017).

Probiotics may also improve inflammatory bowel disorders and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Increased remission rates have been reported in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) when probiotics are started at onset of UC exacerbation and continued for 1 to 2 weeks following resolution of symptoms (Shen et al, 2014). Premature infants have sterile guts at birth and are at risk for bowel problems, including NEC. Multiple studies and reviews have found probiotics beneficial in preventing NEC and death in preterm infants (AlFaleh & Bassler, 2008; Bonsante et al, 2013; Deshpande et al, 2010; Fernandez-Carrocera et al, 2013; Lin et al, 2008). Probiotics improved colic symptoms in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of infants started on probiotics soon afterbirth (Indrio et al, 2014). Use of probiotics improved Symptom Severity Scores in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; Williams et al, 2008). Probiotics have also been found to improve eradication rates in patients being treated for Helicobacter pylori (Tong et al, 2006).

Constipation and functional abdominal pain are challenging disorders to treat. There is some evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in children and adults with IBS, constipation, and functional abdominal pain (Wilkins & Sequoia, 2017). Probiotics should be started at the onset of symptoms to have the greatest effect.

Dosing of probiotics varies depending on strain and product. A Cochrane review indicates that a dosage of 5 billion or greater colony-forming units per day is more effective than a lower dosage in preventing pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea (Goldenberg et al, 2015). Patients should follow the dosing instructions on the label of each probiotic product.
