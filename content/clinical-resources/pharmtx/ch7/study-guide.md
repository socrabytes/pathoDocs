This guide focuses on clinically relevant information for Nurse Practitioners regarding nutrient-drug interactions, nutritional management, and the use of common nutraceuticals.

## I. Nutrient-Drug Interactions: The NP's Crucial Role
**Core Concept:** NPs must understand how food affects drug pharmacokinetics (absorption, metabolism, excretion) and how drugs can lead to nutrient depletion to ensure patient safety and therapeutic efficacy.

### A. Influence of Diet on Drug Pharmacokinetics

**Drug Absorption:**

*   **General Principle:** Food can decrease, delay, accelerate, or increase drug absorption.
*   **Gastric Emptying Time (GET):**
    *   Delayed GET (e.g., high-fat meal) can increase absorption for drugs needing more dissolution time.
    *   Rapid GET (e.g., fasting) can decrease absorption for drugs needing stomach interaction.
    *   Populations with altered GET: Infants, children, pregnant women (delayed); conditions like ulcerative colitis, Crohn's, celiac disease, bariatric surgery.
*   **Gastric pH:** Food alters pH, impacting drug ionization and absorption.
*   **Key Drug-Specific Interactions (High-Yield for Testing):**
    *   **Tetracycline:** Absorption ↓ by calcium, aluminum, iron, magnesium (chelation). **NP Action:** Advise taking on an empty stomach or away from these minerals.
    *   **Phenytoin:** Binds with enteral nutrition products, causing fluctuating levels. **NP Action:** Know protocols for stopping feeds.
    *   **Alendronate (Fosamax):** Bioavailability ↓ by 40% with food, 60% with coffee/orange juice. **NP Action:** Instruct to take with water only.
    *   **Levodopa:** Absorption ↓ by high-protein diet (competition for transport).
    *   **Oral Cancer Therapies (New):** Variable food effects. **NP Action:** Always check manufacturer's directions.

**Drug Metabolism:**

*   **General Principle:** Nutrient intake affects GI and liver metabolism.
*   Low-carb, high-protein diets & cruciferous vegetables can increase drug-metabolizing enzymes.
*   **Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) System Interactions (High-Yield for Testing):**
    *   **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**
        *   **Foods:** Grapefruit, Seville orange, pomelo juice.
        *   **Mechanism:** Decrease first-pass metabolism → ↑ drug levels & adverse effects.
        *   **Affected Drugs:** Calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), some statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin), erythromycin, some benzodiazepines.
        *   **Timing:** Max effect if juice ingested within 4 hours of drug.
    *   **CYP1A2 Inducers/Inhibitors:**
        *   **Inducers (↓ drug effect):** Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage), tobacco, charcoal-broiled meat.
        *   **Affected Drugs:** Theophylline (risk of therapeutic failure).
        *   **Inhibitors (↑ drug effect/risk):** Apiaceous vegetables (carrots, celery, parsley).
    *   **NP Action:** Educate patients on drugs with narrow therapeutic indexes (e.g., theophylline) about these food interactions.

**Drug Excretion:**

*   **General Principle:** Foods can alter urinary pH, affecting drug ionization and renal reabsorption/excretion.
*   **Alkalinize urine (↑ reabsorption of basic drugs):** Milk, vegetables, citrus fruits.
*   **Acidify urine (↑ reabsorption of acidic drugs):** Meat, fish, cheese, eggs.
*   **Example:** Gentamicin (basic) more likely reabsorbed in alkaline urine.

### B. Drug-Induced Nutrient Depletion

*   **General Principle:** Drugs can impair nutrient absorption, synthesis, transport, storage, metabolism, or excretion.
*   **Mechanisms & Examples (High-Yield for Testing):**
    *   Altered GI pH/function: Antacids, K+ therapy → ↓ absorption of folic acid, iron, vitamin B12.
    *   Enzyme inhibition: Phenytoin → ↓ folic acid (inhibits intestinal enzymes for absorption).
    *   Altered renal reabsorption: Loop diuretics → depletion of sodium, calcium, potassium.
*   **NP Action:** Be aware of long-term drug effects causing nutrient deficiencies and consider supplementation.

### C. Clinically Significant Outcomes & NP Role

*   **Key Interaction Scenarios (High-Yield for Testing):**
    *   **Warfarin & Vitamin K:** High Vitamin K foods (kale, spinach) ↓ warfarin efficacy. **NP Action:** Consistent Vitamin K intake education is critical. Refer to Table 7-1 for high Vit K foods.
    *   **MAOIs & Tyramine:** Tyramine-rich foods (aged cheeses, cured meats) + MAOIs → hypertensive crisis.
    *   **Metronidazole & Alcohol:** Disulfiram-like reaction (flushing, headache, N/V).
    *   **Caffeine & Psychotropic Meds:** Can exacerbate conditions or interfere with medication.
    *   **Sorbitol (in sugar-free foods):** Affects GI transit, impacting drug/nutrient absorption.
*   **NP Clinical Decision-Making:**
    *   Comprehensive Assessment: Obtain full medication/supplement list (Rx, OTC, herbal, vitamins, alcohol).
    *   Identify Interactions: Use up-to-date resources (e.g., Drugs.com, Medscape interaction checkers mentioned in text).
    *   Patient Education: Clearly communicate medication administration regarding food, fluids, timing, and specific food interactions. Emphasize reading warning labels.
    *   Monitor & Adjust: If therapy is ineffective or adverse reactions occur, consider food/nutrient interactions.
    *   Collaborate: Consult with pharmacists and registered dietitians.

## II. Nutritional Management & Supplementation
### A. General Principles for NPs

*   Prioritize obtaining nutrients from a varied diet.
*   Supplementation is warranted in specific populations or conditions.
*   Base recommendations on evidence and individual patient needs (RDA, UL).
