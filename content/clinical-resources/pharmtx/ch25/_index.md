## ANTIVIRALS

Viral infections range from the annoying but short-lived and self-limiting "common cold" to the progressive and, to date, incurable HIV. There are over 100 antiviral drugs approved for clinical use (Li et al, 2021). Discussion in this section focuses on antivirals commonly prescribed in primary or ambulatory care, including the nucleoside analogues used to treat varicella and herpes virus infections, and antivirals to treat COVID-19, hepatitis C, and influenza. Chapter 40 discusses drugs to treat HIV. Drugs used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis and other CMV disease in HIV patients (e.g., foscarnet, ganciclovir, valganciclovir) are also discussed in Chapter 40.

Viruses are obligate intracellular agents that depend on use of the host cell's genetic material for replication. As a result, antiviral drugs must either block entry into the cells or be active inside host cells to be effective. Ideally, an antiviral medication would be selective to specific viral components or pathways; however, many antivirals are nonselective, and therefore damage to host cells and virus may result concomitantly. To further complicate treatment, replication of the virus may peak at or before clinical symptoms appear in many viral infections, so optimal clinical efficacy depends on early recognition and treatment or prevention. Finally, many viruses depend on enzymes to reproduce and can quickly mutate in the presence of drug therapy.

Viral replication consists of several steps: (1) adsorption to and penetration into susceptible cells; (2) uncoating of viral nucleic acid; (3) synthesis of early, regulatory proteins; (4) synthesis of RNA or DNA; (5) synthesis of late, structural proteins; (6) assembly of viral particles; and (7) release from the cell. Antiviral drugs target these steps. Many of the currently available antiviral agents act on synthesis of purine and pyrimidine (step 4).

## NUCLEOSIDE ANALOGUES

### Pharmacodynamics

The nucleoside analogues are used mainly to treat herpes infections by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. Acyclovir (Zovirax) is an acyclic guanosine derivative that requires three phosphorylation steps for activation. It is first converted to the monophosphate derivative by the virus-specific thymidine kinase and then to the diphosphate and triphosphate compounds by the host's cellular enzymes. Because it requires the viral kinase for the first step, it is selectively activated only in infected cells. The final step, acyclovir triphosphate, inhibits viral DNA synthesis.

Valacyclovir (Valtrex) is the L-valine ester of acyclovir. It is rapidly converted after oral administration to acyclovir and so its mechanism of action is that of acyclovir; however, serum levels are three to five times higher than those achieved with oral acyclovir.

Famciclovir (Famvir) is the diacetyl ester prodrug of 6-deoxy penciclovir, an acyclic guanosine analogue. It is rapidly metabolized to penciclovir in the intestinal mucosa and liver. Penciclovir has a mechanism of action and spectrum of activity similar to acyclovir. Activation is catalyzed by virus-specified thymidine kinase in infected cells, resulting in competitive inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase and inhibition of DNA synthesis. It has lower affinity for the viral DNA polymerase than acyclovir, but it achieves higher intracellular concentrations and has a more prolonged intracellular effect.

Another nucleoside analogue, ribavirin (Virazole), is active against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza A and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), paramyxoviruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV-1. Oral ribavirin plays a key role when combined with interferon for the treatment of HCV; however, it has not proved beneficial for RSV or HIV-1 infections. It is given via an SPAG-2 aerosol treatment for RSV, usually in the hospital. It is not discussed further in this chapter.

#### Spectrum of Activity

Acyclovir is active against herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2; varicella-zoster virus (VZV); and, to a lesser extent, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, and herpes virus 6 (HSV-6). HSV-6 is implicated as the cause of roseola and other febrile diseases in childhood. Valacyclovir is converted to acyclovir after oral administration and is active against the same viruses. Famciclovir is active against HSV-1 and HSV-2, VZV, EBV, and hepatitis B virus.

#### Resistance

Resistance to acyclovir can develop in HSV and VZV through alteration in either the viral thymidine kinase or viral DNA polymerase. Because most resistance is based on deficient thymidine kinase activity, cross-resistance occurs with acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.

### Pharmacokinetics 

#### Absorption and Distribution

Absorption after oral administration varies by drug. Acyclovir is poorly absorbed orally ( $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ ), although therapeutic levels are achieved at recommended doses. Topical formulations (acyclovir, docosanol, penciclovir) produce local concentrations that may exceed $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{ml}$. in herpetic lesions, but systemic concentrations are undetectable. Valacyclovir is $54 \%$ bioavailable as acyclovir after oral administration. Famciclovir is absorbed in the intestine for conversion to its active form, penciclovir. Food slows absorption but does not affect the extent of absorption. Penciclovir is marketed as a topical preparation only.
Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are widely distributed. Areas of distribution of acyclovir include the brain, kidney, saliva, semen, herpetic lesions, and lung. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations are $50 \%$ of plasma for acyclovir and valacyclovir. Acyclovir and penciclovir are less than $33 \%$ protein bound. Acyclovir crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk.

#### Metabolism and Excretion

Acyclovir is $90 \%$ eliminated in the urine as an unchanged drug, primarily by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The liver metabolizes the remaining $10 \%$. The kidneys also excrete the active metabolite of famciclovir (penciclovir). Because valacyclovir is rapidly converted to acyclovir, it shares the same excretion pattern. Dosage adjustments are required for each of these drugs in the presence of renal impairment because of prolonged half-lives.
Table 25-1 presents the pharmacokinetics of nucleoside analogues for herpes virus infections.

| Drug | Onset | Peak | Duration | Protein Binding | Bioavailability | Half-Life | Elimination |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Acyclovir | UA | $1.5-2.5 \mathrm{~h}$ | 4 h | $9 \%-33 \%$ | $15 \%-20 \%$ | $3-4 \mathrm{~h} ; 20 \mathrm{~h}$ in anuria | $>90 \%$ in urine, remainder metabolized by liver |
| Famciclovir | Rapid | 1 h | $8-12 \mathrm{~h}$ | $20 \%$ | $77 \%$ | $2-3 \mathrm{~h}$; prolonged in renal impairment | Mostly in urine |
| Valacyclovir | UA | $1.5-2.5 \mathrm{~h}$ | $8-24 \mathrm{~h}$ | $13 \%-18 \%$ | $54 \%$ | $2.5-3 \mathrm{~h} ; 14 \mathrm{~h}$ in anuria | $>90 \%$ in urine, remainder metabolized by liver |

UA, information unavailable.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications
Renal failure has been reported with all drugs in this group. Therefore, dose adjustment and cautious use are advised for patients with renal impairment. This caution is also important in older adults, who commonly have diminished renal function or have inadequate hydration. Other nephrotoxic agents should be avoided if possible. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) has been reported with acyclovir therapy.
Acyclovir and valacyclovir are preferred in pregnancy because there are more data supporting the safety of acyclovir, whereas little information is available for famciclovir. Acyclovir is excreted in breast milk; however, the concentrations are low and considered to pose minimal risk to infants. Famciclovir has not been well studied in breastfeeding; therefore, caution or alternative therapy is advised.
Among these drugs, acyclovir is the safest for children. Oral formulations are approved for children older than 2 years of age. Famciclovir does not have established safety and efficacy for children younger than 18 years. The safety and efficacy of valacyclovir have not been established for children.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) vary by drug. Acyclovir has few reactions when given orally at recommended doses. Those reactions associated with short-term administration include headache, skin rash, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. Oral and intravenous (IV) acyclovir therapy has been associated with renal dysfunction. This typically occurs with high doses when the maximum solubility of free drug is exceeded, leading to crystalluria. Acute tubular necrosis has also been reported. Patients receiving IV acyclovir, other nephrotoxic drugs, and those with preexisting renal dysfunction or who are dehydrated are at particular risk of developing renal dysfunction or failure.
Neurological effects such as ataxia, dizziness, confusion, encephalopathy, tremor, and seizures have been reported. Older patients and those with renal dysfunction are more likely to experience these effects. The most frequent adverse reactions associated with famciclovir are headache, dizziness, somnolence, and paresthesias.
Because it is converted to acyclovir, the adverse reactions for valacyclovir are the same as for acyclovir. Valacyclovir does have a higher incidence of adverse reactions compared with oral acyclovir, including serious ones (TTP/HUS) in immunocompromised patients.

#### Drug Interactions

Drug interactions are minimal for acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir. Table 25-2 presents the few drug interactions that exist for nucleoside analogues.

Table 25-2

#### Drug Interactions: Nucleoside Analogues

| Drug | Interacting Drug | Possible Effects | Implications |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Acyclovir, famciclovir | Probenecid | Increased serum levels and terminal half-life of acyclovir, decreased renal clearance | Avoid concurrent use |
|  | Nephrotoxic drugs | Potential increased risk for renal toxicity | Monitor renal function closely |
| Famciclovir | Cimetidine | Penciclovir AUC and urinary recovery increased $18 \%$ and $12 \%$, respectively | No clinical significance |
|  | Theophylline | Penciclovir AUC increased 22\% Renal clearance decreased 12\% | No clinical significance |
|  | Digoxin | $\mathrm{C}_{\max }$ of digoxin increased $19 \%$ in healthy male volunteers | Probably of no clinical significance, but monitor digoxin levels closely to be prudent |

AUC, area under the curve.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing


The most important variable in selecting the dosage of nucleoside analogues is renal function. The dosing interval, dosage, or both are adjusted for patients with impaired renal function, depending on the dosage and degree of impairment. For example, the usual dose of valacyclovir for herpes zoster treatment in a patient with creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ is 1 g every 8 hours, whereas the dosage for a CrCl less than $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ is 500 mg every 24 hours; for acyclovir, the usual dose is 800 mg every 4 hours (five times per day). If CrCl is less than $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, the dose is 200 mg every 12 hours. The prescriber should consult the package insert or a comprehensive reference for specific dosing guidelines.

The nucleoside analogues are recommended for the treatment of infections by the herpes simplex virus commonly seen in primary care, specifically genital herpes, herpes zoster (shingles), varicella (chickenpox), and gingivostomatitis in children. The nucleoside analogues do not cure herpes infections but may shorten duration, decrease severity, and reduce the incidence of sequelae of the infection.

Oral forms of acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are all indicated for primary genital herpes; they increase the rate of healing but do not prevent recurrences. Although topical acyclovir is also approved for treatment of initial herpes genitals infections, it is less effective than the oral nucleoside analogues and is not recommended.

The oral nucleoside analogues should be initiated as soon as possible after the onset of a recurrent episode. Patients are usually provided with a prescription that can be filled at the first sign of recurrence. Topical acyclovir has no benefit in recurrent disease in immunocompetent patients, although it has some value in suppression of mucocutaneous herpes in immunocompromised individuals.

Patients with frequent recurrences can be placed on suppression therapy, which decreases subclinical shedding between active episodes and the number of symptomatic recurrences. In untreated patients, the number of recurrences tends to decrease over time during the first 5 years of the disease. By 3 to 5 years after the initial episode, the number of recurrences may have declined to the point that episodic treatment of recurrences may be preferable. Therefore, the need for suppressive therapy should be reconsidered annually.

Oral acyclovir is indicated for the treatment of varicella in immunocompetent patients when started within 24 hours of the chickenpox rash. For immunocompromised patients, parenteral acyclovir should be used. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend acyclovir for the treatment of uncomplicated chickenpox in healthy children (Kimberlin et al, 2021a). Pregnant women are at risk of developing complications from varicella infection, including varicella pneumonia; therefore, they should be treated with acyclovir to prevent maternal morbidity. Acyclovir is recommended for healthy, nonpregnant patients 13 years and older; children older than 12 months with a chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorder; and children receiving short, intermittent, or aerosolized courses of corticosteroids. If possible, the steroids should be discontinued after known exposure to varicella. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends aggressive treatment of varicella in adults 20 years and older, in that the majority of deaths from chickenpox occur in this age-group. Varicella-zoster immune globulin should be given within 96 hours of known exposure of a susceptible adult. If prophylaxis fails, early initiation of acyclovir within 24 hours of onset of varicella rash is urged. Susceptible adults at high risk (e.g., immunosuppressed, HIV, corticosteroid users) should be vaccinated. Varicella is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in the United States, so vaccination of children is recommended (see Chapter 16 for the latest immunization schedule or go to http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines).

Therapy with nucleoside analogues should be initiated within 3 days of the outbreak of the rash in herpes zoster. Therapy is most effective if initiated within 48 hours of the outbreak of the rash. Drug therapy speeds healing and reduces the duration of postherpetic neuralgia.

Other recommended uses of oral acyclovir include prophylaxis of herpes simplex and herpes zoster in immunocompromised patients, Bell's palsy, and primary gingivostomatitis in children. Parenteral acyclovir is used to treat herpes encephalitis, varicella pneumonia in a pregnant patient, perinatal herpes simplex of mother and neonate, herpes pneumonia, and herpes simiae from a monkey bite.

#### Rational Drug Selection

Three of the nucleoside analogues used to treat herpes simplex infections have shown equal efficacy in the treatment of genital herpes; hence, the selection of the specific agent is based on cost and convenience. Acyclovir is available as a generic preparation and is generally less expensive than the other nucleoside analogues. However, it must be dosed three to five times daily, which may be disruptive and promote noncompliance. Famciclovir is dosed two to four times daily, and valacyclovir requires one to two doses daily, depending on the indication. However, both of the latter drugs are more expensive.

Because of long experience and more extensive research, acyclovir is approved for the most indications, including use by children. Many experts consider valacyclovir to be the drug of choice for treatment of herpes zoster because clinical trials have indicated that it decreased the duration of postherpetic neuralgia in patients older than 50 years better than acyclovir.

#### Monitoring

The characteristic herpetic lesions of genital herpes, herpes zoster, and chickenpox should be evaluated for resolution or signs of secondary bacterial infection. Temperature and general condition also reflect resolution. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine may be assessed before therapy in those with risk factors for renal impairment and periodically during prolonged therapy to detect changes in renal function.

#### Patient Education

**Administration**

The nucleoside analogues can all be taken without regard to meals, in that food does not alter absorption. All forms should be taken with a full glass of water. It is important that the drug be initiated at the earliest sign of recurrence of genital herpes simplex, so the patient must be taught the symptoms of recurrence and how to self-initiate the medication. Early initiation of drug therapy also increases its efficacy for treatment of varicella and herpes zoster, so public education needs to emphasize the treatability of these infections. It is particularly important for adolescents or adults with chickenpox to seek treatment at the first sign of rash or in the prodromal period if they know they are susceptible and have been exposed.

**Adverse Reactions**

Although acute renal failure from precipitation of acyclovir in the tubules is most common with parenteral acyclovir, patients on oral agents have developed acute renal failure and should drink sufficient fluids to remain well hydrated during therapy. Signs of declining renal function that should be reported include abdominal pain, decreased frequency or amount of urination, thirst, anorexia, and nausea or vomiting. Other reportable signs and symptoms include encephalopathic changes (coma, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, tremor), blood dyscrasias (unusual tiredness, chills, fever, sore throat, black stools, unusual bleeding, pinpoint red spots on skin, bruising), and skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome (peeling, blistering, or loosening of skin; muscle cramps, pain, or weakness; red eyes; rash, itching, or hives).

**Lifestyle Management**

Keeping herpetic lesions clean and dry promotes healing. Wearing loose clothing that does not rub on the lesions decreases pain and enhances healing. Herpes genitalis may be sexually transmitted even if the partner is asymptomatic. Sexual activity should be avoided whenever either partner has symptoms. Oral or topical drug therapy does not prevent transmission of the virus. A male or female condom may decrease the risk of transmission, but spermicides and diaphragms have no effect on transmission. Women with a history of genital herpes are more likely to develop cervical cancer; annual or more frequent Pap tests are required. Those who develop postherpetic neuralgia after herpes zoster should be provided with appropriate pain management for this neuropathic pain syndrome.

## ANTIVIRALS FOR COVID-19

The CDC recommends antiviral treatment for outpatients at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Patients at risk for severe COVID-19 include being unvaccinated or not up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations; age over 50 years, particularly age 65 or older; and those with certain medical conditions (CDC, 2022a). The preferred antiviral drugs are nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid) and remdesivir (Veklury). Paxlovid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease.

### Pharmacodynamics

Paxlovid is a combination of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease ( $\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{pro}}$ ), preventing viral replication. Ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor that is not active against SARS-CoV-2 but inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir leading to increased plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir.

Remdesivir is in inhibitor of the e SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase required for viral replication. It is a prodrug that is metabolized into an active metabolite that inhibits viral RNA synthesis.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption and Distribution

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is administered orally, with a peak level of nirmatrelvir in 3.0 hours and ritonavir in 3.98 hours. Nirmatrelvir is $60 \%$ bound to protein and ritonavir $98 \%$ to $99 \%$ protein bound. When nirmatrelvir is administered with a high-fat meal, there is a $15 \%$ increased exposure to nirmatrelvir.

Remdesivir reaches peak levels in 0.67 hours after a 30 -minute IV infusion and is $88 \%$ to $93.6 \%$ protein bound.

#### Metabolism and Excretion

Nirmatrelvir is minimally metabolized. Ritonavir is metabolized via CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 in the liver. The half-life of nirmatrelvir when given with ritonavir is 3 hours, and ritonavir is 3.98 hours. Nirmatrelvir is excreted in the urine and feces; ritonavir is mostly eliminated in the feces (Table 25-4).

Remdesivir is metabolized into active metabolites (GS-441524 and GS704277), which are eliminated in the urine.

*Table 25-4 Pharmacokinetics: Antivirals for COVID-19*

|  Drug | Peak | Protein Binding | Half-Life | Elimination  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) | Nirmatrelvir 3 h
Ritonavir 3.98 h | Nirmatrelvir 69\%
Ritonavir 98\% to 99\% | Nirmatrelvir 6.05 h
Ritonavir 6.15 h | Feces and urine  |
|  Remdesivir (Veklury) | $0.67-0.68 \mathrm{~h}$ | $88 \%-93.6 \%$ | 1 h | Urine as metabolites  |

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications 
A history of hypersensitivity reaction to nirmatrelvir or ritonavir or any other components in the formulation is a contraindication to Paxlovid. Coadministration with drugs that require CYP3A for clearance and that at elevated concentrations may cause a life-threatening reaction are contraindicated (Table 25-5).

The only true contraindication to remdesivir is hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation. In pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg , the manufacturer recommends use of the lyophilized powder formulation only.

Minimal data are available regarding the safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in pregnant patients. Lactation is not a contraindication to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not approved for use in children younger than age 12 years or who weigh less than 40 kg .

There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the safety of remdesivir in pregnant women, although there were no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development in animal studies. Safety and effectiveness of remdesivir have been established for infants and children aged 28 days or older.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir include dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste), diarrhea, hypertension, and myalgia. Postauthorization monitoring identified anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions, abdominal pain, nausea, and malaise as adverse reactions.

The most common adverse reaction when taking remdesivir is nausea. Laboratory abnormalities noted with remdesivir use include increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).

#### Drug Interactions

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and may cause increased plasma levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration with drugs that utilize CYP3A for clearance and that may have serious or life-threatening effects when administered with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is contraindicated (see Table 25-5).

*Table 25-5 Drug Interactions: Antivirals for COVID-19*

| Drug | Interacting Drug | Possible Effects | Implications |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) | Drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions | Serious or life-threatening reactions | Avoid concomitant administration with alfuzosin, amiodarone, colchicine, dihydroergotamine, dronedarone, eletriptan, eplerenone, ergotamine, finerenone, flecainide, flibanserin, ivabradine, lomitapide, lovastatin, lurasidone, methylergonovine, midazolam (oral), naloxegol, pimozide, propafenone, quinidine, ranolazine, sildenafil (when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension), silodosin, simvastatin, tolvaptan, trazolam, ubrogepant, voclosporin |
|  | Drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations | Reduced therapeutic effect |  |
|  | Ethinyl estradiol | Decreased ethinyl estradiol levels | An additional, nonhormonal method of contraception should be considered during the 5 days of treatment and until one menstrual cycle after completing Paxlovid |
| Remdesivir (Veklury) | Chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended | Antagonistic effect | Concomitant use contraindicated |

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine reduce the therapeutic effect of remdesivir. Remdesivir may decrease the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing 

The CDC has published interim guidelines for treating COVID-19 in the outpatient setting with nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid) and remdesivir (Veklury), the preferred treatments (CDC, 2022a). The CDC recommends COVID-19 outpatient treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease due to evidence that Paxlovid reduces risk of hospitalization and death by $89 \%$ (CDC, 2022a). Risk factors for severe disease include patients with chronic lung disease including asthma, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney or liver disease, heart disease, immunosuppression including HIV, obesity, pregnancy, cancer, and tuberculosis (CDC, 2022a).

The guidelines recommend starting nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) as soon as possible and within 5 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. The guidelines recommend nirmatrelvir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg (Paxlovid) orally twice a day for 5 days in adults and children age 12 years and older who weigh 40 kg or more (CDC, 2022a).

Remdesivir may be used for outpatients or patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Treatment of nonhospitalized patients should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 7 days of onset of symptoms. Dosing for adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg is a loading dose of 200 mg IV the first day followed by 100 mg IV daily. For pediatric patients aged 28 days or older, the recommended dose is $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV on day one followed by $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV daily. The length of treatment for nonhospitalized patients is 3 days. Hospitalized patients who do not require ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are treated for 5 days. Treatment may be extended to 10 days if patients do not demonstrate improvement after 5 days or if they require ventilation or ECMO (CDC, 2022a). Table 25-6 presents the dosage schedule for antivirals for COVID-19.

*Table 25-6 Dosage Schedule: Antivirals for COVID-19*

| Drug | Indications | Forms | Dose | Comments |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) | COVID-19 | Tablet | 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet), with all 3 tablets taken together bid for 5 days | Dose reduction for moderate renal impairment (eGFR $\geq 30$ to $<60$ $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ : 150 mg nirmatrelvir/100 mg ritonavir bid for 5 days Not recommended if eGFR $<30$ $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Remdesivir (Veklury) | COVID-19 | Injection | Pediatric patients aged 28 days and 3 kg to $<40 \mathrm{~kg}: 5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ on day 1 , followed by $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ <br> Adults and children $\geq 40 \mathrm{~kg}: 200 \mathrm{mg}$ on day 1 , followed by 100 mg daily <br> Outpatient: treat for 3 d <br> Hospitalized: 5 d <br> Hospitalized requiring ventilation or ECMO: 10 d | Start within 7 days of COVID diagnosis |

#### Rational Drug Selection

Oral nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid) is the first-line outpatient treatment per the guidelines due to its oral formulation that allows for ease of home administration (CDC, 2022a). Remdesivir may be administered in the outpatient setting, but it is intravenous and requires trained nurses or providers to administer. Hospitalized patients should be treated with remdesivir.

#### Patient Education

**Administration**

Oral nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid) may be taken with or without food. Patients should not chew, break, or crush the tablets. The importance of completing the full 5 days of treatment and continuing COVID-19 isolation procedures should be emphasized. If a patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours of scheduled time, the patient should take the dose at the next regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double a dose to make up for missed doses. Due to the large number of drug interactions, a pharmacist should be consulted regarding potential drug interactions.

For outpatients, remdesivir is administered once a day IV for 3 days. If patients are hospitalized, they will receive the medication once a day for 5 to 10 days.

**Adverse Reactions**

Patients should be educated regarding the expected adverse effects of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid), which include dysgeusia (altered taste), abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, hypertension, and myalgias. Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions may occur.

The most common reaction to remdesivir is nausea. Signs of a hypersensitivity reaction should be discussed with the patient before the infusion begins, and patients advised to report any symptoms consistent with an allergic response. Patients may also have elevated liver enzymes and will need laboratory testing to evaluate their liver function.


### ANTIVIRALS FOR HEPATITIS C

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and may lead to the need for liver transplantation. Treatment has rapidly evolved in the past decade, with highly effective antiviral therapies introduced in 2011 that can eradicate HCV to the point of undetectable HCV RNA level after 12 weeks of treatment. The development of effective HCV treatment has dramatically changed the outlook for patients diagnosed with chronic HCV. Guidelines for HCV treatment were developed as a joint statement by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2014 and are continuously updated, with updates found at www.hcvguidelines.org. Treatment of HCV infection is based on the genotype and stage of the disease, and consultation with a specialist in managing HCV infections is recommended before starting therapy. The antivirals used to treat chronic HCV will be briefly discussed here, with an understanding that providers should refer to the HCV guideline website for the most current information.

### Pharmacodynamics

Most of the HCV antivirals are formatted as a fixed-dose combination of two antivirals. The combinations include ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa), glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (Mavyret, Maviret), and elbasvir/grazoprevir (Zepatier). A four-drug combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, plus dasabuvir (Viekira Pak, Viekira XR, Holkira Pak) is available. Ledipasvir, pibrentasvir, elbasvir, and ombitasvir inhibit the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein, which is the protein necessary for viral replication. Sofosbuvir, a prodrug that is converted to its active form (GS-461203), inhibits HCV NS5B polymerase. Velpatasvir is an NS5B inhibitor. Glecaprevir, grazoprevir, and paritaprevir inhibit HCV NS3/4A protease, which is necessary for viral replication. Dasabuvir inhibits HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is necessary for viral replication. Ritonavir is a CYP3A inhibitor that inhibits the metabolism of paritaprevir, increasing plasma concentration of paritaprevir.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption and Distribution

All of the HCV antiviral medications are administered orally and are widely distributed, including to hepatic tissues. The pharmacokinetics of the HCV antivirals are found in Table 25-7.



*Table 25-7 Pharmacokinetics: Antivirals for Hepatitis C*

|  Drug | Onset | Peak | Duration | Protein
Binding | Bioavailability | Half-Life | Elimination  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Dasabuvir |  | 4 h |  | $99 \%$ | $70 \%$ | $5.5-6 \mathrm{~h}$ | $94.4 \%$ feces  |
|  Elbasvir |  | 3 h |  | $99.9 \%$ | $32 \%$ | 24 h | Feces  |
|  Glecaprevir |  | 5 h |  | $97.5 \%$ |  | 6 h | Feces  |
|  Grazoprevir |  | 2 h |  | $98.8 \%$ | $27 \%$ | 31 h | Feces  |
|  Ledipasvir |  | 4 h |  | $99.8 \%$ |  |  | Feces  |
|  Pibrentasvir |  | 5 h |  | $>99.9 \%$ |  | 13 h | Feces  |
|  Sofosbuvir |  | 1 h |  | $61 \%-65 \%$ |  |  | Feces  |

#### Metabolism and Excretion

Ledipasvir and pibrentasvir are not metabolized and are excreted unchanged in the feces. Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolized in the liver into an active metabolite, which is excreted mostly in the urine. Elbasvir, glecaprevir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and grazoprevir are metabolized by CYP3A4 and excreted primarily via the feces. Velpatasvir is metabolized by CYP2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 and excreted in the feces. Dasabuvir is metabolized by CYP2C8 and excreted mostly $(94.4 \%)$ in the feces.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

All of the HCV antivirals have the risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation, leading to a boxed warning to test all patients for current or prior HBV infection before starting the HCV antivirals. Patients who are not concurrently treated for HBV infection may develop fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. The combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) may cause ALT elevations that usually resolve with ongoing therapy or completion of therapy. Women, Asian patients, and patients older than age 65 years are at highest risk. Patients should have liver enzyme tests before therapy, at week 8 of treatment, and afterward as indicated. The combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (Mavyret) is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). The combination drug ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, plus dasabuvir (Viekira) is contraindicated in moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C). Safety and efficacy of HCV antivirals during pregnancy have not been established. HCV-infected women should be advised to avoid pregnancy until after treatment. Treatment of pregnant women should be delayed until after delivery. It is not known if the HCV antivirals are excreted in breast milk.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

Headache, fatigue, and nausea are the most frequent adverse effects reported for all the HCV antivirals. Patients taking ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (Harvoni) also complain of muscle weakness and myalgias. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (Epclusa) may cause increased serum lipase three times the upper limits of normal in $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ of patients. Patients taking glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (Mavyret) may experience diarrhea and increased serum bilirubin ( $4 \%$ ). Elbasvir-grazoprevir (Zepatier) has a slight chance ( $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ ) of causing increased serum ALT. Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, plus dasabuvir (Viekira) may cause insomnia ( $5 \%$ ), pruritus ( $7 \%$ ), skin rash ( $7 \%$ ), increased serum ALT up to five times normal ( $1 \%$ ), and increased bilirubin ( $2 \%$ ).

#### Drug Interactions

Coadministration of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (Harvoni) and amiodarone may cause serious symptomatic bradycardia. The acid-reducing drugs (antacids, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors) will cause decreased ledipasvir levels. Coadministration with digoxin will cause increased digoxin levels. Anticonvulsants and some antimycobacterials may lead to decreased ledipasvir and sofosbuvir levels. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (Epclusa) may cause serious bradycardia if coadministered with amiodarone. Drugs that are inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir. Glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (Mavyret) levels may be decreased if coadministered with drugs that induce P-gp/CYP3A. Glecaprevir-pibrentasvir may cause fluctuations in international normalized ratio (INR) in patients taking warfarin. Elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) are substrates of CYP3A and P-gp, and grazoprevir is a substrate of OATP1B1/3 transporters. Coadministration with OATP1B1/3 inhibitors (cyclosporin and many HIV medications) may increase grazoprevir concentrations and are contraindicated. Coadministration of elbasvirgrazoprevir with strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated, and coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended. Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir (Viekira) interact with the angiotensin receptor blockers, causing increased concentrations of angiotensin receptor blocker. Viekira also causes increased concentrations of CYP3A4 inhibitors, including antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers, ketoconazole, quetiapine, forosemide, the statins rosuvastatin and pravastatin, cyclosporine, buprenorphine, hydrocortisone, and alprazolam. See Table 25-8 for drug interactions with HCV antivirals.

*Table 25-8 Drug Interactions: Antivirals for Hepatitis C*


|  Drug | Interacting Drug | Possible Effects | Implications  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir (Viekira PAK, Viekira XR) | Substrates of CYP3A, UGT1A1, BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 | Increased plasma concentrations of interacting drug | Avoid coadministration  |

ALT, alanine aminotransferase; INR, international normalized ratio.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

Dosing of the HCV antivirals is complex and dependent on the genotype of the HCV virus, whether the patient is treatment-naive, and their renal and hepatic function. Table A5–9 describes clinical use and dosing for treatment-naive patients. Further dosing information can be found at the HCV guidelines website.

#### Rational Drug Selection

Drug selection is based on the patient's genotype, liver function, and whether they are treatment-naive. See the HCV guidelines website.

#### Monitoring

Before starting HCV antivirals and periodically, patients should have their bilirubin, liver enzymes, and serum creatinine levels drawn. Serum HCV-RNA is drawn at baseline, during treatment, and after treatment is completed. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody should be drawn before initiation of therapy. HCV viral load levels are drawn 12 weeks after completion of treatment to evaluate viral response.

#### Patient Education

**Administration**

Patients taking HCV antivirals need to be educated regarding the medications they are taking and known drug reactions. Patients need to be educated regarding taking the medication every day for the full duration of therapy, as well as whether the medication is taken with food.

**Adverse Reactions**

Patient education regarding HCV antiviral adverse effects includes the common ADRs of fatigue, headache, and nausea. Other common ADRs should be discussed with the patient with instructions to contact their provider before stopping the medication due to ADRs.

**Lifestyle Management**

Discussion of HBV reactivation and reasons for taking continuous dosing is critical. Follow-up to check viral load is essential to determine whether the infection has cleared.

## ANTIVIRALS FOR INFLUENZA

Zanamivir (Relenza), oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu), and peramivir (Rapivab) are approved for treatment of acute illness in adults. Zanamivir has been approved for children age 7 years or older and oseltamivir for children older than 2 weeks. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofinza) is approved for ages 5 years and older. Antivirals to treat influenza are the most effective in patients who have been symptomatic less than 48 hours. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are approved for prophylaxis of influenza in patients aged 3 months or older and 5 years and older, respectively. Baloxavir is approved for postexposure prophylaxis in persons aged 5 years or older. Zanamivir should not be used in patients with underlying respiratory disease. Therapy is recommended for patients who are hospitalized, have severe disease, or are at risk of developing complications. The CDC updates recommendations for antivirals annually based on prevalent influenza strains and resistance patterns. The antiviral drugs do not substitute for vaccination.

Amantadine (Symmetrel) and rimantadine (Flumadine) are FDA approved for prevention and treatment of respiratory infections due to influenza A virus; however, the CDC no longer recommends their use due to high levels (up to 92%) of resistance to influenza A (Fiore et al, 2011). These agents will not be discussed further in this chapter. Amantadine and rimantadine are discussed in Chapter 12 in the drugs for Parkinson disease sections.

### Pharmacodynamics

#### Mechanism of Action

Zanamivir, oseltamivir, and peramivir are neuraminidase inhibitors and are active against influenza A and B. Neuraminidase is a viral enzyme responsible for cleaving viral attachment to the host cell surface, allowing for viral circulation. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents release of the virus and halts propagation of infection. Vaccination does not appear to alter the activity of zanamivir, oseltamivir, or peramivir.

*Table 25-9 Dosage Schedule: Antivirals for Hepatitis C*

|  Drug | Indications | Forms | Dose | Comments  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir (Viekira PAK, Viekira XR) | PAK:XR: Genotype 1B | PAK: Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir 12.5/75/50 mg tablets and dasabuvir 250 mg tablet Extended release tablet: dasabuvir 200 mg , ombitasvir 8.33 mg , paritaprevir 50 mg , ritonavir 33.3 mg | PAK: 2 tablets once a day for 12 wkXR: 3 tablets once a day for 12 wk |   |
|  Elbasvir/grazoprevir (Zepatier) | HCV genotype 1 or 4 | Tablet: elbasvir 50 $\mathrm{mg} /$ grazoprevir 100 mg | One tablet once a day for 12 wk |   |
|  Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (Mavyret) | HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection | Tablet: glecaprevir 300 $\mathrm{mg} /$ bibrentasvir 120 mg | One tablet once a day for 8 wk | Treat for 12 wk if patient has cirrhosis  |
|  Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) | HCV genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 infection | Tablet: ledipasvir 90 $\mathrm{mg} /$ sofosbuvir 400 mg | One tablet once a day |   |

Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted to baloxavir, the active form that inhibits endonuclease activity of the polymerase acidic (PA) protein, resulting in inhibition of influenza virus replication.

#### Resistance

Resistance to zanamivir and oseltamivir is associated with mutations that result in amino acid changes in the viral neuraminidase. Sporadic cases of oseltamivir resistance occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Almost all cases were associated with an H297Y mutation that retained susceptibility to zanamivir. After the 2009 pandemic, the CDC concluded that there is no evidence of continued transmission of this resistant influenza A virus (Fiore et al, 2011). Peramivir was approved in 2014 and baloxavir marboxil was approved in 2018. There is no documented resistance to either of these newer medications.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption and Distribution 
Oseltamivir is available as an oral tablet and is well absorbed after administration. Oseltamivir is a prodrug of the active compound oseltamivir carboxylate. Zanamivir is a dry powder available for oral inhalation with a provided inhalation device. Approximately $4 \%$ to $17 \%$ of the inhaled dose of zanamivir is systemically absorbed. Oseltamivir is poorly distributed into breast milk (LactMed, 2022a); distribution of zanamivir into breast milk is unknown. Zanamivir is poorly absorbed orally, so it is unlikely to be absorbed by the breastfeeding infant in significant amounts. Protein binding of oseltamivir is around $42 \%$ and that of zanamivir is less than $10 \%$. Peramivir is administered IV and is $30 \%$ bound to protein. Peramivir and baloxavir marboxil have not been studied in nursing mothers.

#### PRESCRIBING PEARL

**CDC Influenza Antiviral Recommendations**

The CDC tracks influenza worldwide to determine circulating and emerging strains. Weekly updates on flu activity and surveillance provide information on what strains are circulating in each state. It also provides recommendations for the use of antivirals during influenza season, including updates as resistance patterns emerge. Providers can refer to "Information for Health Professionals," accessible at http://www.cdc.gov/flu, for the latest information.

#### Metabolism and Excretion

Oseltamivir is almost completely converted to the active metabolite (greater than $90 \%$ ). The active metabolite is excreted unchanged in the urine. Children 12 years and younger have higher clearance of oseltamivir and its metabolite, resulting in decreased drug exposure. Zanamivir is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. Peramivir is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidneys. Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted to its active metabolite, baloxavir, which is excreted in the feces.

*Table 25-10 Pharmacokinetics: Antivirals for Influenza*


| Drug | Onset | Peak | Duration | Protein <br> Binding | Bioavailability | Half-Life | Elimination |

UA, information unavailable.

### Pharmacotherapeutics 

#### Precautions and Contraindications

Treatment with antiviral medications is recommended for pregnant people with influenza. Oseltamivir and zanamivir have multiple observations studies during pregnancy, and have not been found to have increase adverse pregnancy outcomes (CDC, 2022b). Baloxavir is not recommended by the CDC in pregnancy or lactation due to no available safety or efficacy data in pregnant people (CDC, 2022b). Oseltamivir is poorly excreted in breast milk and is not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants. There is no information available regarding zanamivir use during breastfeeding. The inhaled medication is poorly absorbed orally, so it is assumed there would be little effect on the breastfed infant with maternal use. For zanamivir and oseltamivir, safety and efficacy have been established for children as described previously. Safety and effectiveness of peramivir and baloxavir marboxil have not been established in children.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

Bronchitis, cough, and shortness of breath are associated with use of zanamivir. These problems may be related to irritation from inhalation of the drug; however, reactions may be related to the underlying illness because the incidence of reactions was either equal or greater in the placebocontrolled groups. For oseltamivir, nausea and vomiting are the most common adverse effects and occurred more frequently than in placebocontrolled groups. Rare cases of severe skin reactions and neuropsychiatric events have been reported for all three medications.

#### Drug Interactions

No drug interactions are reported for oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir. Baloxavir marboxil absorption is decreased by polyvalent cationcontaining laxatives, antacids, or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc). Although they have not been formally evaluated, these agents may impair immune response if coadministered with the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). LAIV should not be administered 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of either drug. The inactivated virus vaccine can be administered without regard to antiviral drug administration.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

Oseltamivir and zanamivir are approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza types A and B. Peramivir is approved for the treatment of acute influenza in patients aged 6 months or older, and baloxavir marboxil is approved for age 5 years and older.

Treatment is recommended for patients identified with influenza who are hospitalized, have severe disease, or are at risk of developing complications. No dosage adjustment is recommended for zanamivir for patients with renal impairment, but because the active metabolite of oseltamivir is excreted renally, adjustment is recommended. For patients with CrCl of 10 to $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, the treatment dose should be reduced to once daily and the prophylactic dose to once every other day. Peramivir dosage is decreased in patients with decreased renal function.

The CDC maintains an updated website with information regarding recommendations for antivirals based on the circulating influenza strain (http://www.cdc.gov/flu). These recommendations are updated based on emerging resistance patterns; therefore, the provider is wise to refer to the recommendations multiple times during the influenza season.

*Table 25-11 Dosage Schedule: antivirals for Influenza* 

| Drug | Indications | Forms | Initial Dose | Comments |

CrCl , creatinine clearance; FDA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

#### Rational Drug Selection 

The benefit of influenza drugs is tempered by the need to initiate treatment within 48 hours of the onset of the illness. Although the presence of fever, cough, myalgia, and known influenza activity in the community provide the basis for clinical diagnosis, these symptoms are not definitive. Rapid testing for influenza should be conducted if available. These tests take no more than 20 minutes, and have acceptable sensitivity and specificity.

The selection of an anti-influenza agent depends on the adverse effect profile, cost, and convenience. The inhaled route of administration of zanamivir has the advantage of decreased systemic effects compared with oseltamivir, but the inhalation procedure may contribute to noncompliance. Peramivir is administered IV in a single dose and may be the drug of choice in patients unable to take oral or inhaled medications.

#### Monitoring

Baseline evaluation of renal function should be considered for older and debilitated patients who are taking oseltamivir or peramivir. For older and debilitated patients, monitoring should include breath sounds (for evidence of heart failure or development of pneumonia), heart sounds, and weight. Vital signs will also evidence resolution of the influenza and development of adverse effects or sequelae.

#### Patient Education

**Administration**

As with all antivirals, the importance of taking the full course of therapy and following the label directions should be stressed. Patients on zanamivir require instruction on the proper use of the diskhaler. Oseltamivir can be taken without regard to food.

**Adverse Reactions**

If asthmatics on zanamivir experience severe bronchospasm after using the diskhaler, an alternative treatment may be needed. Nausea and vomiting are common with use of oseltamivir.

**Lifestyle Management**

The single most important factor in influenza prevention is annual vaccination. It is now recommended that all people 6 months and older be vaccinated. The wholesale cost of a course of therapy with a neuraminidase inhibitor is approximately $\$ 45$ to $\$ 67$, exclusive of diagnostic testing, whereas the cost of annual vaccination is $\$ 12$ to $\$ 25$. Other components of prevention include good hand washing, disposing of contaminated tissues properly, and encouraging infected individuals to convalesce at home rather than in crowded schools and workplaces.

## SYSTEMIC AZOLES AND OTHER ANTIFUNGALS

Fungi are eukaryotic cells with a nucleus and a rigid cell wall. Reproduction generally occurs via asexual sporulation. Fungi occur ubiquitously in soil, water, air, and on plants. Although few are capable of causing disease in humans, the incidence of infection has increased dramatically in recent years due to increased use of immunosuppressive drugs and the rising incidence of HIV.

Most fungi are completely resistant to conventional antibiotics, and new classes of drugs were created to treat them. There are four main classes of antifungal drugs. The first class, macrocyclic polyenes, includes amphotericin B (AmBisome, Abelcet, Amphotec). Because this drug is available only in IV formulations, it will not be discussed further in this chapter. The second main class, the azole group, includes two subgroups, the imidazoles and the triazoles. The imidazoles are used mainly for topical treatment and are discussed in Chapter 23. The triazoles include fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox), isavuconazole (Cresemba), posaconazole (Noxafil, Posanol), and voriconazole (Vfend). The third main class, allylamines, includes terbinafine (Lamisil). The fourth main class, nuclear acid synthesis inhibitors, includes flucytosine (Ancobon), the use of which is limited to treatment of cryptococcosis.

Griseofulvin is a miscellaneous antifungal. Other antifungals used mainly as topical preparations include butoconazole (Gynazole1), ciclopirox (Loprox), clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin, Lotrimin, Mycelex), econazole (Spectazole), ketoconazole (Nizoral), miconazole (Micatin, Monistat), naftifine (Naftin), nystatin (Nystop, Nyamyc), oxiconazole (Oxistat), terconazole (Terazol), tioconazole (Vagistat), and tolnaftate (Tinactin, Absorbine, Aftate). The topical use of antifungals to treat dermatological infections is discussed in Chapters 23 and 35, and their use in treating vaginal infections is discussed in Chapter 48. This section discusses the systemic use of antifungals via the oral route of administration. The drugs most commonly used in primary care settings to be discussed here include fluconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and terbinafine.

### Pharmacodynamics

Fungal cell membranes are comprised of components similar to those found in human cells with the exception of the cholesterol ergosterol. This component serves as the target for most systemic antifungal agents. Azole antifungals reduce ergosterol production by inhibition of the fungal CYP450 enzyme 14 -a-demethylase. Although mainly inhibiting fungal CYP450, some inhibition of human CYP450 occurs, resulting in potential drug interactions and adverse reactions. Fluconazole appears to have the least effect on human CYP450.

In general, the azoles are fungistatic at low drug concentrations and fungicidal at higher concentrations. Terbinafine interferes with the synthesis of ergosterol at an earlier step than the azoles through inhibition of squalene epoxide. Cell death is thought to occur by accumulation of squalene and not due to the decreased availability of ergosterol.

#### Spectrum of Activity

The azoles have a broad spectrum of activity that includes Candida species, Cryptococcus species, the endemic mycoses (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis), and the dermatophytes. In addition, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole have reliable activity against Aspergillus species. The azoles are approved for a variety of clinical syndromes caused by various fungi. The use of itraconazole has been mainly supplanted by voriconazole because it has superior clinical efficacy. Use of itraconazole is now limited to treatment of histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. Although possessing activity against Aspergillus and Candida species, posaconazole is used almost exclusively for prophylaxis of bone marrow transplant patients and for infection refractory to other agents. Isavuconazole is a novel, broad-spectrum azole that treats most yeasts and molds, including fluconazoleresistant Candida strains, Aspergillus, and Zygomyces.

Terbinafine (Lamisil) has in vitro activity against yeasts and a wide range of dermatophyte, filamentous, and dimorphic fungi. It is fungicidal against dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton species, Microsporum species, and Epidermophyton floccosum. It is fungistatic against C. albicans. Terbinafine is only approved for treatment of onychomycosis (fungal infection of the nails) but is used off-label for tinea capitis (fungal infection of the scalp), tinea corporis (fungal infection of the body), tinea pedis (fungal infection of the feet-athlete's foot), and tinea cruris (fungal infection of the groin-jock itch). Oral terbinafine is not effective in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor; the concentrations attained by oral terbinafine in the stratum corneum are not adequate to treat this infection.

#### Resistance

Resistance to azoles occurs through a variety of mechanisms. Although less common, the incidence of resistance is increasing as these drugs are used for prophylaxis as well as therapy. C. krusei is intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, and alternative therapy should be used. The CDC reports $7 \%$ of all Candida from bloodstream isolates are resistant to fluconazole (CDC, 2020a). The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute developed a classification of "susceptible dose-dependent" for fluconazole against C. glabrata. Isolates in this category may still be treated effectively with fluconazole if higher doses are used. Approximately $19 \%$ of Aspergillus infections in medical centers in some parts of the world are resistant to azoles (CDC, 2022c). Cross-resistance between fluconazole and voriconazole for C. glabrata has been shown to be significant, and caution is advised if considering voriconazole for treatment (Wang et al, 2017).

The emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida auris has become an emerging threat worldwide. C. auris was first identified in Asia in 2009, with the first cases identified by the CDC in the United States in 2016. Spread in the United States has been rapid, with over 5,000 cases of C. auris in 2022 (CDC, 2022d). Up to $90 \%$ of cases of C. auris in the United States are resistant to fluconazole and up to one third resistant to amphotericin B (CDC, 2020b). The CDC is tracking the spread of C. auris infections in health-care facilities closely, recommending that health-care facilities that suspect they have a patient with C. auris contact state or local public health officials for testing and treatment guidance.

### Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of the different azoles and of terbinafine vary significantly. Table 25-12 presents these pharmacokinetic differences.

*Table-25-12 Pharmacokinetics: Systemic Antifungal Agents*


| Drug | Onset | Peak | Duration | Protein Binding | Bioavailability | Half-Life | Elimination |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Fluconazole | Slow | $1-2$ h | 24 h | $11 \%-12 \%$ | $>90 \%$ | $30 \mathrm{~h}^{*}$ | $>80 \%$ unchanged in urine; $11 \%$ as metabolites in urine |
| Isavuconazole (Cresemba) |  | 3 h |  | $>99 \%$ | $98 \%$ |  |  |
| Itraconazole | Rapid | $1.5-5$ h | $12-24$ h | $99 \%$ | $55 \%$ | 21 h-64 h | $40 \%$ in urine as inactive metabolites; $3 \%-18 \%$ in feces |
| Ketoconazole | Rapid | $1-4$ h | 24 h | $99 \%$ | $75 \%$ | 8 h | $85 \%-90 \%$ in bile and feces; $10 \%-15 \%$ in urine |

UA, information unavailable.
*Increased in renal impairment.

#### Absorption and Distribution 

Fluconazole is well absorbed after oral administration, with excellent bioavailability (greater than 90\%). It is widely distributed with good penetration into CSF, the eye, and the peritoneum.
Itraconazole is available for oral administration as a solution and a capsule. The bioavailability of the capsule and solution are not equivalent. The absorption of the capsule is enhanced when it is taken with food, resulting in a bioavailability of $55 \%$. When taken on an empty stomach, absorption of the solution is about $30 \%$ greater than that of the capsule (Barone et al, 1998). Patients taking antacids ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blockers and proton pump inhibitors) should not take the capsule because absorption is markedly decreased; absorption of the solution is not affected. Due to higher bioavailability, the solution should be used preferentially in all instances (Wheat et al, 2007). Tissue concentrations are higher than plasma concentrations. Itraconazole does not enter the CSF but does enter breast milk.

Posaconazole is available for oral administration as a suspension, delayed-release oral suspension, and delayed-release tablet and IV formulation. Absorption is highly variable but has been shown to be enhanced when taken with a high-fat meal. It is recommended to take oral posaconazole within 20 minutes of a meal or liquid nutritional supplement.
Voriconazole is available in IV, oral tablet, and oral suspension formulations. The tablet and suspension are equivalent in absorption and have excellent bioavailability (greater than $90 \%$ ) in adults, with bioavailability variable in children under age 12 years ( $45 \%$ to $64 \%$ ).
Peak serum levels are reached in 2 to 3 hours after oral administration of isavuconazole sulfate capsules. Oral bioavailability is $98 \%$. Isavuconazole is $99 \%$ protein bound.
Terbinafine is well absorbed after oral administration, with bioavailability of $70 \%$ to $85 \%$, and is not affected by the presence of food. It is lipophilic and extensively distributed. It concentrates in the stratum corneum, attaining concentrations 25 times that in plasma. It is also distributed via the sebum to hair follicles, skin, and nails. It is not known whether terbinafine crosses the placenta, but it does enter breast milk.

#### Metabolism and Excretion

Fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with $80 \%$ appearing as unchanged drug in the urine and $11 \%$ as metabolites. All azoles are inhibitors of various CYP450. Fluconazole inhibits CYP3A4 and 2C9 but has the least inhibition of the azoles discussed in this chapter. Half-life is markedly affected by renal impairment, with an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and CrCl . Dosage adjustments are required for patients with impaired renal function.
Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into several active metabolites, and fecal excretion varies from $3 \%$ to $18 \%$ of the dose. Itraconazole and its metabolites are inhibitors of CYP3A4. About $40 \%$ of the dose is excreted in urine as metabolites.
Posaconazole undergoes metabolism by CYP450, with approximately $14 \%$ of the dose excreted as an inactive metabolite in the urine. The remainder is excreted as unchanged drug in the feces. Similar to other azoles, posaconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4.
Voriconazole is extensively metabolized by CYP450, and dose reduction is required in poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 ( $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of those of Asian descent; Scholz et al, 2009). This agent is also a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. Excretion is almost entirely nonrenal.
Isavuconazole sulfate is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed by esterases into active isavuconazole. The active isavuconazole is metabolized by CYP3A4, 3A5, and uridine glucuronyl transferase (UGT). The metabolites are excreted in the urine and feces.
Terbinafine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Metabolism involves only a small fraction (less than $5 \%$ ) of the hepatic CYP450 capacity, so the drug interactions that are common with the azoles do not affect terbinafine. Fifteen inactive metabolites have been identified. About $80 \%$ of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites, and $20 \%$ is eliminated in the feces. Both liver impairment and renal impairment require dosage reduction.
Table 25-12 depicts the pharmacokinetics of these selected systemic antifungals.


### Pharmacotherapeutics 

#### Precautions and Contraindications

All of the azoles and terbinafine have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Ketoconazole has a boxed warning regarding hepatotoxicity leading to death or requiring liver transplant, and therefore should not be used in the treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Rare cases of hepatitis that are usually reversible with discontinuance of the drug have been reported. Transaminase elevations are common with the azoles and occur in $2 \%$ to $12 \%$ of patients. Monitoring of transaminases is recommended. The azoles and terbinafine are used cautiously for patients with hepatic impairment. For those patients with renal impairment undergoing extensive renal elimination, cautious use is required. With both hepatic and renal impairment, dosage adjustments may be required. The dose of fluconazole should be reduced by $50 \%$ when the CrCl is less than 50 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Because of the burden on the liver, terbinafine should be used with caution by patients with alcoholism, either active or in remission.
Itraconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole have teratogenic effects in animals. There are no adequate, wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. These drugs should be used during pregnancy only when the potential benefits to the mother clearly outweigh the risks to the fetus and there is no reasonable alternative drug. Women of childbearing age who are prescribed isavuconazole should have a pregnancy test before starting and use effective contraception during and for 28 days after administration. Animal studies of terbinafine show no effects on fertility or fetal toxicity, but adequate studies in humans have not been conducted.
Fluconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole, and terbinafine are excreted in breast milk; no data exist for posaconazole and voriconazole. After a single 500 mg dose of terbinafine, 0.2 to 0.7 mg of terbinafine was detected in breast milk. Despite these low concentrations, it is prudent to avoid administration of antifungal drugs to nursing mothers.
The safety and efficacy of these drugs in children vary. The safety and efficacy of itraconazole and isavuconazole have not been established for children. Fluconazole is safe and effective for infants and children. Experience prescribing fluconazole to neonates is limited, but a dosage schedule exists. Terbinafine may be used in children over 10 kg to treat tinea capitus and onychomycosis. Voriconazole may be used in neonates with severe fungal infections, but higher doses per weight of voriconazole may be required in children younger than 15 years or less than 50 kg . Posaconazole is approved for use in children aged 2 years to 18 years for the treatment of invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

Azoles are relatively nontoxic, and the most common adverse reactions are relatively minor gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Patients taking azoles have rarely developed exfoliative skin disorders. Patients who develop rashes should be carefully monitored and the drug discontinued if the lesion progresses. All of the azoles may cause QT prolongation. Itraconazole has been rarely associated with development of heart failure and should be used cautiously in patients with preexisting heart failure or ventricular dysfunction. Voriconazole causes visual disturbances in up to $19 \%$ of patients. These changes include photopsia (flashes of light), photophobia, and color changes. This usually occurs within 30 minutes of administration and lasts for about 30 minutes. These effects usually subside after several weeks of use. In addition to visual changes, patients may experience more serious neurological symptoms, including visual hallucinations, confusion, agitation, and myoclonus, which are usually associated with toxic drug levels. Isavuconazole may cause elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin that are reversible, although serious hepatic ADRs have been observed in patients with hepatic malignancy. Ketoconazole oral tablets may cause hepatotoxicity leading to death or need for liver transplant and should only be used when no other effective antifungal therapy is available (U.S. FDA, 2013).
The most common adverse reactions with terbinafine are also GI in nature and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Terbinafine may cause hepatotoxicity, ranging from mild to liver failure. Reversible loss or change of taste has occurred after 5 to 8 weeks of therapy, requiring 2 to 6 months to recover after the drug was discontinued. Other adverse effects reported include hypersensitivity, headache, hepatitis, blood dyscrasias, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

#### Drug Interactions

Drug interactions are more common for the drugs with greater human CYP450 activity. All of these drugs are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and other CYP enzymes as well (see earlier discussion). Additive hepatotoxicity is also possible with other hepatotoxic drugs.
Itraconazole has many drug interactions, including rifampin, histamine-2 blockers, and warfarin. Fluconazole has slightly fewer drug interactions but interacts with rifampin and warfarin.
Isavuconazole is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, and coadministration of ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, and rifampin are contraindicated due to increased exposure of isavuconazole when taken concurrently. Isavuconazole should be used with caution in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir, atorvastatin, cyclosporin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, midazolam, mycophenolate mofetil, and digoxin due to increased exposure of interacting drug. Isavuconazole will decrease bupropion exposure.
Additive hepatotoxicity may occur with concurrent administration of terbinafine, alcohol, or other hepatotoxins. Because terbinafine is hepatically metabolized by CYP450, drugs that induce or inhibit these enzymes may alter the clearance of terbinafine. Those interactions that have been documented for the azoles and terbinafine are listed in Table 25-13.

*Table 25-13 Drun Interactions: Selected Systemic Antifungal Agents*

|  Drug | Interacting Drug | Possible Effects | Implications  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Fluconazole | Cimetidine Hydrochlorothiazide | Reduced fluconazole AUC. Significant increase in fluconazole AUC, possibly because of reduced renal clearance. | Separate doses. Avoid concurrent use.  |
|   | Rifampin Phenytoin | Increased phenytoin AUC. A single dose of fluconazole after chronic rifampin resulted in a decrease in AUC and a shorter half-life for fluconazole. | Monitor serum phenytoin levels. If both meet for taken, monitor effectiveness of fluconazole and adjust dose if needed.  |
|   | Sulfonylureas | Significant increase in AUC of toblastanide, glyburide, and glipizide. Several patients experienced hypoglycemic episodes, some requiring oral glucose treatment. | If both meet for used, monitor blood glucose levels closely while acrole is taken.  |
|   | Theophylline | Theophylline AUC and half-life increased and clearance decreased. Increased toxicity risk. | Monitor serum theophylline levels. Dosage adjustment may be needed.  |
|   | Warfarin | Fluconazole increases effects of warfarin, which results in an increase in PT/INR and risk of bleeding. | Monitor PT/INR closely while taking acrole.  |
|  Isonoconazole | Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole) | Fivefold increase in isonoconazole levels | Coadministration is contraindicated.  |
|   | Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (rifampin) | Increased isonoconazole exposure (95% increase) | Use with caution  |
|   | Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (rifampin, St. John's wort, carbamazepine) | Decreased isonoconazole levels (up to 97%) | Coadministration with rifampin contraindicated.  |
|   | CYP3A4 substrates (midazolam, sirolimus, tacrolimus, bupropion, mycophenolate mofetil, digoxin) | Increased exposure to midazolam, sirolimus, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, digoxin. Decreased exposure to bupropion. | Coadminister with caution.  |
|   | Lopinavir/ritonavir | Increased exposure (up to 2 times normal) of substrate | Use caution in coadministration.  |
|  Itraconazole | Benzodiazepines | Elevated plasma concentrations of oral midazolam and triazolam. Prolonged sedative/hypnotic effects. | Select different benzodiazepine.  |
|   | Buspirone | May elevate buspirone levels, increasing the pharmacological and adverse effects. | Closely monitor clinical response to buspirone. Product is start with conservative dose and adjust dose of buspirone as needed.  |
|   | Calcium channel blockers Phenytoin, phenobarbital, isoniazid, carbamazepine | Edema with concurrent use of dihydropyridines. Increased metabolism of itraconazole. Decreased metabolism of phenytoin. | Monitor cardiac status. Increased dosage of acrole may be needed. Monitor phenytoin levels; dosage adjustments may be needed.  |
|   | Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, oral hypoglycemic agents, and warfarin | Itraconazole decreases metabolism of these drugs. Increased risk for toxicity, hypoglycemia, and anticoagulant effect. | Monitor cyclosporine levels. Monitor for indications of hypoglycemia. Monitor PT/INR.  |
|   | Digoxin Aniazide, H2 blockers, and other drugs that increase gastric pH | Increased digoxin levels. Reduced plasma itraconazole levels. | Monitor digoxin levels closely. Much less of a problem with oral solution than with caprofen.  |
|  Ketoconazole | Aniazide, H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and other drugs that increase gastric pH | Inhibit ketoconazole absorption | Avoid concurrent use. Fluconazole absorption is not affected.  |
|   | Rifampin, isoniazid | Bioavailability and serum levels of either drug may be affected | Avoid concurrent use.  |
|   | Hepatotoxic drug | Additive hepatotoxicity | Avoid concurrent use.  |
|   | Cyclosporine, corticosteroids, warfarin | Ketoconazole decreases metabolism of these drugs. Increased risk for toxicity, anticoagulant effect. | Monitor serum levels. Monitor PT/INR more closely. Because the effect on cyclosporine levels is consistent and predictable, this combination has been used therapeutically to reduce cyclosporine dosage.  |
|   | Theophylline | Increased serum theophylline levels | Monitor theophylline levels. Dosage adjustment may be needed.  |
|  Posaconazole | Sirolimus | Increased sirolimus levels | Contraindicated  |

Because of its long half-life, fluconazole does not achieve steady state for 5 to 10 days with standard doses, but it can be achieved in 2 days with a loading dose (twice the usual dose) on the first day. Hence, most dosage regimens for fluconazole include a loading dose. Because it may undergo saturation metabolism at higher plasma concentrations, the initial dose of itraconazole is often doubled, resulting in a threefold increase in the plasma concentration. However, patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency may need reduced maintenance doses of fluconazole and terbinafine. For serious infections, voriconazole should be administered IV as a loading dose over the first day. Isavuconazole is available in oral or IV formulations, and patients may be switched between these formulations. No loading dose of isavuconazole is required.

#### Rational Drug Selection

Antifungal drug selection is based on susceptibility, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects. The spectrum of terbinafine includes dermatophytes, and it is recommended for treatment of onychomycosis and tinea infections. The spectrum of the azoles includes dermatophytic and superficial fungi, as well as invasive systemic fungi. Fluconazole has more reliable bioavailability than the other azoles and is generally recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate systemic fungal infections. Fluconazole also has fewer drug interactions than other azoles and has a single-dose regimen for some indications, and it is preferred by many clinicians for these reasons. It is considered the drug of choice for treating vaginal yeast infections in patients with diabetes. Increasing fluconazole resistance needs to be considered when choosing fluconazole as first-line therapy for simple vaginal candidiasis. As discussed previously, itraconazole should be reserved for blastomycosis and histoplasmosis because alternative treatments for other indications are preferred. Fluconazole is available as a generic and is the most affordable azole.

#### Monitoring

Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential with oral antifungal drugs. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin should be monitored before initiation of therapy, monthly for 3 to 4 months, and frequently thereafter during treatment. Because of the numerous drug interactions with azoles, it is important to monitor the drug response of concurrent medications. Therapeutic response should be evaluated at 6 to 8 weeks after initiation of drug therapy for tinea infections, 4 to 6 months for fingernail onychomycosis, and 8 to 9 months for toenail mycoses. Monitoring of serum drug levels for several azoles is recommended as stated previously.

#### Patient Education

**Administration**

Itraconazole capsules should be taken with food to alleviate GI symptoms and promote absorption. Antacids should not be used in conjunction with the capsule. Itraconazole solution should be taken on an empty stomach; fluconazole, terbinafine, and voriconazole can be taken without regard to meals. Posaconazole should be taken with a high-fat meal. Because these drugs have many drug interactions, any time a new drug is added to the patient's treatment regimen, it should be reviewed for possible interactions.

**Adverse Reactions**

Because hepatotoxicity is common to all the oral antifungals, concurrent use of alcohol is discouraged. Patients should report signs of liver toxicity (unusual tiredness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, pale stools, dark urine), Stevens–Johnson syndrome (rash, blisters, loosening of skin, red joints), and leukopenia (sore throat or fever). Patients on terbinafine should know that loss of taste is a reversible adverse effect.

**Lifestyle Management**

Factors that have contributed to the rise of fungal infections are overuse of antibiotics, increased numbers of immunocompromised patients, and increased environmental exposure. Patients and providers should try to limit antibiotic use, which will decrease emergence of bacterial resistance and fungal superinfection.

## Anthelmintics

Human parasitic worms are divided into three groups: nematodes ([intestinal and tissue] roundworms), cestodes (flatworms and tapeworms), and trematodes (flukea; McCarthy et al, 2011). The common helminthic infections in the United States are caused by intestinal nematodes: *Enterobius vermicularis* (pisworm), *Trichuris trichiura* (whipworm), *Ascaris lumbricoides* (roundworm), *Strongyloides stercoralis* (threashworm), and the hookworms *Ancylostoma duodenale* and *Necator americanus*. Only drugs used to treat these infections are discussed in this chapter.

### Pharmacodynamics

The benzimidazoles (mebendazole, thiabendazole [Mintezol], albendazole [Albenza]) bind to β-tubulin of the microtubule causing inhibition of polymerization and loss of function. In addition, these agents have a range of other possible inhibitory mechanisms including blocking glucose uptake. Thiabendazole is no longer available in the United States or Canada for human use and will not be discussed.

Pyrantel pamoate (Pin-Away, Pin A, Asees's Pinworm Medicine) is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that creates spastic paralysis in the worm. It also inhibits cholinesterases. Ivermectin (Strumectol) binds selectively to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels of the muscle and nerve, resulting in hyperpolarization, paralysis, and eventual death of the parasite.

Drugs of choice for treating intestinal nematodes include mebendazole and pyrantel. Tissue nematodes are best treated with mebendazole, albendazole, or ivermectin.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption and Distribution

Ivermectin is well absorbed with wide tissue distribution after oral administration. Albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel are very poorly absorbed with limited serum concentrations. The bioavailability of albendazole and ivermectin is significantly enhanced if coadministered with a fatty meal (2.5- to 3-fold increase). Absorbed albendazole is widely distributed in nearly all organs and body compartments. The distribution of mebendazole and pyrantel is not known.

#### Metabolism and Excretion

Albendazole is rapidly converted by the liver to the primary metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide, which is further converted to other metabolites. These metabolites undergo almost exclusive biliary elimination. Absorbed mebendazole is extensively metabolized by the liver. More than 95% is excreted in feces and the remainder by the kidney. Ivermectin is metabolized by CYP450. The parent drug and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in feces over an estimated 12 days. Pyrantel pamoate undergoes limited metabolism, and more than 50% is excreted as unchanged drug in the feces. Less than 7% is found in urine as parent drug and metabolites. Table 25–15 presents the pharmacokinetics of selected anthelmintics.

**Table 25–15.** Pharmacokinetics: Selected Anthelmintics

|  Drug | Onset | Peak | Protein Binding | Bioavailability | Half-Life | Elimination  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Albendazole | UA | 2–5 h | 70% | UA | 8–12 h | Mainly in urine; small amount in feces  |
|  Ivermectin | UA | 4 h | UA | UA | 16 h | Fecal elimination; <1% in urine  |
|  Mebendazole | UA | 2–4 h | 95% | 2%–3% | 2.5–5.5 h | >90% fecal elimination; 2% in urine  |
|  Pyrantel pamoate | UA | 1–3 h | UA | UA | UA | 50% unchanged drug in feces; <7% in urine  |
|  Thiabendazole | Rapid | 1–2 h | UA | UA | 1.2 h | 5% in feces; 90% in urine  |

Duration of action of all of these drugs is unknown. UA, information unavailable.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

Because the activity of these drugs is specific to the parasites, precautions and contraindications are minimal. Drugs extensively metabolized by the liver require cautious administration to patients with hepatic impairment. Drugs excreted extensively by the kidney may require careful monitoring of renal function. Albendazole and mebendazole have been linked to rare reports of bone marrow suppression.

Albendazole and ivermectin have demonstrated teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in some animal studies. The World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that for albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks and allow administration to pregnant women in their second or third trimester (CDC, 2023). For ivermectin, the WHO excludes pregnant patients from mass prevention campaigns (CDC, 2023).

It is not known whether albendazole, mebendazole, or pyrantel pamoate is excreted in breast milk. Caution should be exercised if used by a nursing mother. Ivermectin is known to be excreted in breast milk in low quantities equaling 0.98% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose (Lachfeld, 2022b).

Mebendazole and pyrantel pamoate are not recommended for children younger than age 2 years. Albendazole is not recommended for children younger than 2 years (although no adverse reactions have been found in studies of children as young as 1 year). In children weighing less than 15 kg, ivermectin is contraindicated.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

The most common adverse reactions associated with use are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, transient abdominal pain, fever, pruritus, and skin rash. Albendazole and mebendazole are associated with transient elevations of liver function tests and, rarely, hepatitis. Reversible bone marrow suppression has also occurred with both of these agents.

Some patients taking ivermectin for treatment of *Onchocerca volvulus* experience the Mazzotti reaction (fever, headache, dizziness, somnolence, weakness, rash, pruritus, diarrhea, joint pain and muscle spasms, hypotension, tachycardia, lymphadenitis, and peripheral edema). The reaction is due to the death of *Onchocerca volvulus* and is not related to ivermectin toxicity. Corticosteroids may be needed for several days to suppress the inflammatory response.

#### Drug Interactions

There are few drug–drug interactions with any of these drugs. Table 25–16 lists these interactions.

**Table 25-16.** Drug Interactions: Selected Anthelmintics

|  Drug | Interacting Drug | Possible Effects | Implications  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Albendazole | Dexamethasone | Steady-state trough of main metabolite 50% higher | Avoid coadministration  |
|  Mebendazole | Carbamazepine, phenytoin | May reduce plasma levels of mebendazole; possible decrease in therapeutic effects | Avoid concomitant use  |
|   | Cimetidine | Increased plasma concentrations of mebendazole | May be used therapeutically  |
|  Pyrantel pamoate | Theophylline | May increase serum levels of theophylline | Monitor theophylline levels  |
|  Thiabendazole | Xanthines | Thiabendazole may compete with these drugs for metabolism sites; may elevate serum levels of xanthine with increased toxicity risk | Monitor serum levels of xanthine closely  |

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

The five common intestinal helminthic infections in the United States are described here, with indication of the usual antimicrobial agents. Dosages of the anthelmintic drugs are summarized in Table 25-17.

**Enterobio/Transluderic (Pleevora)**

The pleevora is named for the morphology of the posterior of the female. As many as 50 million people in the United States, primarily children, are infected with pleevora. The primary symptoms of pleevora, perianal itching and sleep disruption, are related to the fact that the female lays eggs nocturnally in the perianal area. Drugs used to treat pleevora include pyrantel pamoate, albendazole, and mebendazole. Pyrantel pamoate is available over the counter (OTC) and has a 100% cure rate if two doses are given a weeks apart.

**Trichoric Trichines (Whipworm)**

Some 1 billion people worldwide are infected with whipworm (CDC, 2010). People acquire whipworm by ingesting uncooked vegetables grown in soil contaminated by human feces. The infection is usually asymptomatic, although heavy infestations may produce anemia, bloody diarrhea, and growth retardation. Drugs used for whipworm infections include pyrantel pamoate, albendazole, and mebendazole.

**Aconic Leukotoxins (Roundworm)**

The roundworm is the most common helminthic parasite worldwide and affects 807 to 1.2 billion people worldwide and 96 to 4 million in the United States, primarily in the Southeast (CDC, 2010b). Infection generally is derived from eating feces-contaminated raw vegetables. The parasite has a larval stage that migrates through the lungs, causing seasonal pneumonitis, but GI symptoms are more common. Massive infections can cause intestinal obstruction. The drugs used for roundworm infections are mebendazole, albendazole, and ivermectin.

**Amylovorus Duodenale or Pecator Ansericatus (Hookworm)**

Hookwormes comprise pathogens from two genera, A. duodenale and N. americanus. The larvae live in the soil and must penetrate the skin to enter the circulation, where they are carried to the lungs. Have they penetrate the alveoli, crawl up the pharynx, and are swallowed. They attach to the intestinal wall and can cause anemia. A recent phenomenon is the use of hookworms to treat allergies and asthma. Although there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of this treatment, patients can purchase hookworms via the Internet and self-medicate. Drugs used for hookworm infections include pyrantel pamoate, albendazole, and mebendazole (CDC, 2014a).

**Table 25-17.** Dosage Schedule: Selected Anthelmintics

Take after meals. |

**Strongyloides Stercoralis (Threadworm)**

The larvae of the threadworm are found in warm, moist soil in the tropics and the southern United States. The larvae may penetrate the skin or be ingested. Pulmonary and GI symptoms are common. The first-line drug used for threadworm infections is ivermectin; albendazole is an alternative.

**Scabies**

Ivermectin may be prescribed off-label to selected patients with scabies. It is particularly effective in treating scabies in patients who are immunocompromised. The dosage is $200 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose given as two doses a week apart (CDC, 2019b).

#### Rational Drug Selection

The CDC website and guidelines should always be consulted before choosing and initiating anthelmintic drug therapy. Patient-specific factors such as pregnancy status and age should be carefully considered when choosing therapy. Albendazole and pyrantel pamoate are both available as a suspension. Pyrantel pamoate is also available OTC, which may reduce inconvenience and promote adherence.

#### Monitoring

Evaluation of the efficacy of the anthelmintic drugs includes assessing the eradication of the helminth. For $E$. vermicularis, cellophane tape swabs of the perianal area should be obtained before starting and 1 week after drug therapy, especially in patients with persistent symptoms. The swab should be obtained every morning before defecation and bathing for at least 3 days to determine proof of cure.

For roundworms, hookworms, ascariasis, trichuriasis, and whipworms, stool samples are obtained before and 1 to 3 weeks after treatment to determine proof of cure. For strongyloidiasis, routine stool examinations and special examinations such as the Baermann technique may be required before treatment and repeated at intervals of 3 months, beginning at 6 weeks after treatment, to establish proof of cure.

Patients taking prolonged therapy with these agents should have periodic evaluation of hepatic function and complete blood counts. These tests should also be repeated whenever there is clinical evidence of hepatotoxicity or blood dyscrasias.

#### Patient Education

**Administration**

The available dosage forms are shown in Table 25-17. Albendazole should be swallowed whole with a small amount of water and a high-fat meal to decrease GI effects and increase absorption. Mebendazole is also taken with a high-fat meal, but it can be chewed or crushed. Ivermectin must be taken with a full glass of water on an empty stomach 1 hour before a meal. Pyrantel pamoate can be taken without regard to meals or time of day.

**Adverse Reactions**

Women of childbearing capacity should take albendazole after a negative pregnancy test in the first 7 days after the onset of menses and should use a backup barrier method of contraception for 1 month after completing therapy. Albendazole should not be used in conjunction with cimetidine, which decreases clearance of albendazole. Patients who have recently taken albendazole should also report signs of neutropenia (sore throat, fever, unusual tiredness). Mebendazole should also be avoided during pregnancy.

Ivermectin can cause lightheadedness, so hazardous activities should be avoided during therapy. Use may be associated with a skin rash or itching during treatment of strongyloidiasis because of the death of microfilariae in the skin. If serious, this syndrome may require short-term therapy with corticosteroids to suppress the inflammatory response.

**Lifestyle Management**

Patients with hookworm and whipworm infections may require iron replacement therapy. Eradication of pinworm infections usually requires simultaneous treatment of all household contacts; a vigorous hygiene program of cleaning bed linens, nightwear, and underwear; and good hand washing habits. Contrary to popular belief, treatment of helminthic infections does not require special diets or purging with laxatives before or after the antimicrobial drug.

## METRONIDAZOLE, NITAZOXANIDE, AND TINIDAZOLE

Metronidazole (Flagyl) is effective at managing bacterial as well as parasitic infections and is therefore discussed separately from the other antibiotic classes. It is available in oral, intravenous, and topical preparations. Topical applications are discussed in Chapters 23 and 35 for skin conditions and in Chapter 48 for vaginal disorders. Nitazoxanide (Alinia) is used in the treatment of diarrhea caused by G. lamblia and C. parvum. Tinidazole (Tindamax) is approved for treatment of amebiasis, bacterial vaginosis, giardiasis, and trichomoniasis. Both nitazoxanide and tinidazole are available only for oral administration.

### Pharmacodynamics

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole that disrupts DNA and protein synthesis. Upon entry into the microorganism, the nitro group of metronidazole is reduced, creating a highly reactive molecule that binds nonspecifically and deactivates DNA and other proteins. It has reliable activity against gram-positive and gramnegative anaerobes including Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides fragilis, and Fusobacterium species. It also has activity against H. pylori, Entamoeba histolytica, T. vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and G. lamblia.

Nitazoxanide interferes with the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction, which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism in the protozoa. It is active against the sporozoites and oocysts of C. parvum and trophozoites of G. lamblia.

Tinidazole is an antibacterial and antiprotozoal agent with mechanism of action similar to metronidazole. Like metronidazole, it undergoes intracellular nitro group reduction and is thought to subsequently deactivate DNA and other proteins. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, tinidazole has activity against Bacteroides species, Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella species, G. lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption and Distribution 
Oral metronidazole is readily absorbed and widely distributed into most tissue and fluids, including CSF, breast milk, alveolar tissue, bone, liver abscesses, vaginal secretions, and seminal fluid, as well as crossing the placenta. Serum levels are proportional to the administered dose and are similar for oral and IV routes. After administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly metabolized to two active metabolites, tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide. Administration with food is recommended as the area under the curve (AUC) and $\mathrm{a}*{\text {max }}$ are both decreased when taken without food. An oral suspension of nitazoxanide is available and has roughly $70 \%$ of the bioavailability of the oral tablet. The active metabolites of nitazoxanide are poorly distributed, with $99 \%$ of tizoxanide bound to plasma proteins. Tinidazole is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Administration with food does not appreciably alter absorption. It is widely distributed to virtually all tissues, crosses the blood-brain barrier and the placental barrier, and is secreted in breast milk.

####Metabolism and Excretion

Metronidazole is metabolized into several degradation products with the majority ( $60 \%$ to $80 \%$ ) being renally eliminated. Tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are mainly excreted in the feces (about two-thirds) with a small portion excreted renally (about one-third). Tinidazole undergoes extensive metabolism by $\mathrm{CFP}_{3} \mathrm{~A}_{4}$. It is excreted by the liver and can also be recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. Table 25-18 presents the pharmacokinetics of these three drugs.

**Table 25-18 Pharmacokinetics: Metronidazole, Nitazoxanide, and Tinidazole**

|  Drug | Onset | Peak | Duration | Protein Binding | Bioavailability | Half-Life | Elimination  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Metronidazole | Rapid | $1-3 \mathrm{~h}$ | 8 h | $<20 \%$ | $100 \%$ | 7.5 h | 20\% unchanged in urine; $6 \%-15 \%$ in feces  |
|  Nitazoxanide | UA | $1-4 \mathrm{~h} ; 2-8 \mathrm{~h}^{\circ}$ | 12 h | $99 \%$ | Tablet: 100\%; oral suspension: $70 \%$ | UA | As metabolites  |
|  Tinidazole | UA | 1.6 h | 72 h | $12 \%$ |  | $12-14 \mathrm{~h}$ | 12\% excreted in feces; $20 \%-25 \%$ unchanged in urine  |

UA, Information unavailable. ${ }^{1}$ The first number is for the tizoxanide metabolite; the second number is for the tizoxanide glucuronide metabolite.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

Cautious use is recommended with metronidazole for patients with a history of blood dyscrasias. Seizures have occurred as an adverse reaction, and patients with a history of seizure disorder or neurological problems should use this drug with caution. Severe hepatic dysfunction may decrease plasma clearance, and metronidazole should be used cautiously with these patients. Tinidazole is also a nitroimidazole and has the same precautions and contraindications.

The pharmacokinetics of nitazoxanide in patients with compromised renal or hepatic function has not been studied. It must be administered with caution to patients with hepatic and biliary disease and to patients with renal disease or a combination of the two.

Metronidazole crosses the placenta, and several studies have shown the development of cleft palate when the fetus is exposed during the first trimester. Metronidazole is contraindicated for treatment of trichomoniasis during the first trimester. It has been used to treat trichomoniasis in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, but not as a single-dose regimen. Although this drug has been used for more than 20 years with no increase in congenital abnormalities, stillbirths, or low birth weight reported, as with any drug given during pregnancy, prudence suggests that it be used only when clearly indicated.

Animal studies of nitazoxanide have shown no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. However, there are no adequate, well-controlled studies in humans, and it should be avoided in the first trimester. It should be used only when clearly indicated and when there is no other reasonable drug.

Tinidazole has not been studied in pregnant patients but is known to cross the placental barrier. It should not be given to pregnant patients in the first trimester. Given the long history of use of metronidazole, it is a better drug choice for treatment of G. lamblia in pregnancy.

A nursing mother who needs metronidazole should interrupt nursing for 24 hours and use a single-dose regimen if clinically appropriate. Nitazoxanide is excreted in breast milk, and the choice to use it for a lactating mother should be made with extreme caution. Tinidazole is excreted in breast milk in measurable amounts for 72 hours after the last maternal dose; the manufacturer recommends against breastfeeding while taking tinidazole and for 72 hours after the last dose.

The safety and efficacy of metronidazole in children have been established, and it is recommended to treat a variety of anaerobic infections in children. A single tablet of nitazoxanide contains more drug than is allowed for pediatric patients 11 years or younger; only oral suspension should be used for children aged 1 to 11 years. It should not be used for children younger than 1 year. Nitazoxanide is approved for treatment of G. lamblia and C. parvum in children. Tinidazole is approved for treatment of intestinal amebiasis and giardiasis in children 3 years or older.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

Anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and headache commonly occur with metronidazole. Dry mouth and a metallic taste may also develop. Although irritating, these adverse reactions are mild and transient. Infrequent adverse reactions include diarrhea, glossitis, rashes, leukopenia, seizures, aseptic meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Taking the drug with meals lessens the GI irritation. GI irritation with abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea are the main adverse reactions for nitazoxanide. Adverse effects associated with tinidazole are similar to those for metronidazole.

#### Drug Interactions

Drug interactions with all three drugs are few. As metronidazole undergoes metabolism by $\mathrm{CFP}_{4} \mathrm{~g}_{0}$, known inhibitors (such as cimetidine) and inducers (such as phenytoin, phenobarbital) affect drug concentration. Because metronidazole potentiates the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, the prothrombin time/interventional normalized ratio (PT/INR) should be carefully monitored. A disulfiram-like reaction may occur with alcohol ingestion, and patients are warned not to consume alcohol while taking this drug and for 48 hours after completing it.

Metronidazole may increase serum levels of lithium and close monitoring is recommended. Drug interactions are similar for tinidazole. Nitazoxanide is heavily bound to plasma proteins and may interact with other drugs that are also heavily protein bound (competition for binding sites), especially those with narrow therapeutic ranges (e.g., warfarin). Drug interactions are listed in Table 25-19.

**Table 25-19 Drug Interactions: Metronidazole, Nitazoxanide, and Tinidazole**


|  Drug | Interacting Drug | Possible Effects | Implications  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

Metronidazole and tinidazole have antiparasitic and antibacterial properties. They are used against the common protozoal infections by T. vaginalis, G. lamblia, and E. histolytica. Metronidazole is also used to treat less common parasites, such as the protozoon Balantidium coli (with an oral dose of 750 mg three times daily for 5 days), as an alternative to tetracycline, and to treat the helminth Dracunculus medinensis, or guinea worm (with an oral dose of 250 mg three times daily for 10 days). Antibacterial uses of metronidazole include treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, bacterial vaginosis, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and eradication of $H$. pylori in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Many of the anaerobic bacterial infections treated with metronidazole are serious, even life-threatening, with treatment initiated in the hospital. Dosages of metronidazole for these diverse conditions are summarized in Table 25-20. In severe hepatic or renal disease, the dosage of metronidazole may need to be decreased; increased dosages might be required for successful therapy of patients taking inducers of hepatic CYP450, such as phenobarbital and phenytoin. Nitazoxanide is used for diarrhea caused by G. lamblia or C. parvum. Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by T. vaginalis, giardiasis, bacterial vaginosis, intestinal amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess.

##### Trichomonas Vaginalis

*Trichomonas vaginalis* infection often occurs during or shortly after menses and is characterized by copious foamy discharge with a pH greater than 5, positive "swoll" test,* punctate hemorrhages of vaginal mucosa, and vaginal irritation. Although it is generally sexually transmitted, the organism can live for weeks on wet towels and toilet seats, as fomite transfer is theoretically possible. In sum, the infection may cause urethral discharge, but it is usually mild, if present at all. Both partners should be treated and a condom used during intercourse for a week to prevent reinfection. The CDC's sexually transmitted infection guidelines recommend treatment with metronidazole for men with a single dose of 4 g for 1 day and for women with 500 mg twice a day for 7 days (CDC, 2012). Tinidazole 2 g orally to a single dose can be used for men or women. If the infection occurs in the first trimester of pregnancy, deferral of treatment is recommended. Experts disagree over whether the drug or short treatment is preferable during pregnant and nonpregnant states. Single-dose therapy promotes compliance, especially if administered under supervision.

Both partners should be treated. Tinidazole should be avoided during pregnancy, so metronidazole is the preferred drug in those circumstances.

##### Giardiasis

The life cycle of the protozoon *G. lamblia* involves two stages: a cyst and a trophozoite. The cyst form can live in cold water for months and is ingested by the human foots. It can also be transmitted during sexual activity. The trophozoite—a actively metabolizing, motile form—fores in the upper two-thirds of the small intestine and can be so numerous that it can mechanically interfere with digestion. *Giardia* infections may be asymptomatic or cause disease ranging from self-limiting diarrhea to a severe chronic syndrome with malnutrition.

In the United States, metronidazole, 450 mg three times a day or 500 mg two times a day for 5 to 7 days in adults and 5 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 5 to 7 days in children, is used to treat giardiasis. Asymptomatic cyst passeses should also be treated. The nitazoxanide dose in adults is 500 mg twice daily for 3 days. Nitazoxanide is FDA-approved for treatment of *G. lamblia* in children older than 1 year and will also treat intestinal parasites. Dosing of nitazoxanide for children aged 1 to 3 years is 100 mg twice a day for 3 days, 200 mg twice a day in children aged 4 to 11 years, and children aged 12 years or older are prescribed the adult dose. Nitazoxanide is available in an oral suspension to make administration easier and more accurate in very young children. Tinidazole dosing to treat giardiasis in adults is a single 2 g dose with food and 50 mg/kg (19) to 4 g) in children older than 3 years. A single dose of tinidazole in children aged 3 years or older is 80% to 100% effective and has a better side-effect profile in children than metronidazole (Kimberlin et al, 2012b). Doses are provided in Table 23-20.

##### Amebiasis

Several species of Entamoeba infect humans, but *E. histolytica* is the only species known to cause disease. Like many protozoa, Entamoeba has two life stages: the cyst and the trophozoite. Infection of the human usually involves ingestion of cysts from focally contaminated food, water, or hands. Transmission of cysts and trophozoites can also occur with food exposure during sexual contact. In the intestine, cysts undergo oxygenation into the trophozoite form and multiply. In many cases, the cysts remain in the intestinal lumen (noninvasive infection), resulting in asymptomatic carriers and cyst passers. In some patients, the cysts invade the intestinal lumen (invasive intestinal disease), resulting in diarrhea or dysentery. Trophozoites also can travel through the bloodstream to form abscesses in the liver, brain, or lung (extraintestinal disease) that are manifested by local signs such as hepatomegaly or cholestasis. Drugs administered for presumptive treatment (broad-spectrum antibiotics, kaolin, bismuth, soapsoak enema, tartum) can suppress shedding of amoeba into the stool and delay diagnosis. For invasive intestinal amebiasis in adults, metronidazole 500 to 750 mg orally three times daily for 7 to 10 days may be used (39 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours divided into three doses in children). Metronidazole can be used to treat the extraintestinal form of the disease if no orally.

Metronidazole is an well absorbed that it is not effective against the noninvasive infection, and it may be necessary to add a luminal amebicide-like paromomycin (Itomatin), 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days. Paromomycin is an unabsorbable aminoglycoside similar to neomycin. If the intestinal mucosa is not intact, as in noninvasive inflammatory bowel disease, paromomycin can be absorbed and cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.

Tinidazole may also be prescribed for invasive intestinal amebiasis or anaerobic liver abscess. The adult dose of tinidazole for invasive intestinal amebiasis or liver abscess is 2 g daily with food for 3 days. The pediatric dose of tinidazole for invasive intestinal amebiasis or liver abscess is 50 mg/kg/day daily for 3 days. The advantage of tinidazole is the once-daily dosing.

##### Bacterial Vaginoids

Bacterial vaginosis develops when the bacterial flora are altered, with loss of the normally predominant lactobacilli and overgrowth of strict and facultative aerobic species such as *Bacteroides, Peptococcus, Mobiluncus, Gardnerella, Streptococcus,* and *Mycoplasma*. The infection manifests with foul-edured, clear, copious vaginal discharge with a pH greater than 4.5, positive "whiff test," and free white blood cells (WBCs). Untreated bacterial vaginosis has been associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, cervicitis, abnormal Pap smear cytology, preterm labor, and low birth weight. During pregnancy, symptomatic women are screened and treated if they are at high risk for preterm delivery. Treatment of low-risk and symptomatic women during pregnancy is controversial. Metronidazole, 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, or metronidazole intravaginal gel 0.75%, 1 full applicator (5 g) daily for 5 days, is the drug of first choice for bacterial vaginosis (CDC, 2012). Dosing in pregnant women is 500 mg twice a day for 7 days or 550 mg three times a day for 7 days (CDC, 2012).

Tinidazole is an alternative treatment for bacterial vaginosis. The recommended dose of tinidazole in nonpregnant women with bacterial vaginosis is a 2 g oral dose once daily for 2 days taken with food or a 1 g oral dose once daily for 5 days taken with food (CDC, 2012). Use of tinidazole in pregnant women has not been studied. It is not necessary to treat sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis unless balantia is present. Doses are provided in Table 23-20.

##### Cryptosporidium parvum

Nitazoxanide is the only drug in this group approved for treatment of the diarrhea caused by *C. parvum* in children 11 years old or younger. Its safety and efficacy have not been established for older children or adults, but doses are provided in the literature for these age-groups. Its action appears to be caused by interference with the IP68 enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction essential for anaerobic energy metabolism in the organism. This protein sequence is similar to the one used by *G. lamblia*. Dosing for each age-group is found in Table 23-20.

##### Rational Drug Selection

For most of the infections for which metronidazole is used, it is the drug of choice because it is clearly more efficacious than the alternatives. Metronidazole is on many retail 84 lists, so cost is not an issue. Issues in drug selection for these conditions are the lack of effective alternatives for use in the first trimester of pregnancy, comparative efficacy of the long- and short-term oral dosing regimen, and the choice between topical and oral forms for vaginal infections.

For *G. lamblia*, nitazoxanide and tinidazole have FDA approval for this indication in children; metronidazole use is off-label. Only nitazoxanide has approval for treatment of *C. parvum* infections.

#### Monitoring

For most of the conditions treated with metronidazole, resolution of symptoms indicates effective treatment and further evaluation is not required. For giardiasis treated with any of these drugs, symptoms may persist for weeks or months after the organism is eradicated because of the lactose intolerance brought on by the infection (Bartelt, 2022). If symptoms persist, three stool samples should be collected and cultured several days apart about 3 to 4 weeks after completion of treatment.

#### Patient Education

**Administration**

Although oral metronidazole and tinidazole can be taken without regard to meals, they should be taken with food or snacks to decrease GI irritation. Nitazoxanide should be taken with food and the oral suspension should be shaken well before administration. If vaginal or topical preparations of metronidazole are used, the patient should be provided with instruction and the opportunity to manipulate a model applicator in the office. Use of the extended-release form of metronidazole that can be administered once daily should be considered if nonadherence is an issue, although the vaginal gel and delayed-release oral form are considerably more expensive than other oral forms.

**Adverse Reactions**

Chewing sugarless gum or sucking on ice or candy can help to overcome the dry mouth and metallic taste that metronidazole can cause. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided during therapy with metronidazole or tinidazole and for 48 hours after the last dose because disulfiram-like reactions occur in about 40% of patients who consume alcohol. Because metronidazole can cause dizziness or lightheadedness, hazardous activities should be avoided until the patient's response to the medication is established. Headache is a common adverse effect of metronidazole that can be treated with acetaminophen or an NSAID.

Metronidazole causes a harmless darkening of urine. Female patients should be counseled about the symptoms of vaginal candidiasis superinfection, which can complicate therapy and could be mistaken for recurrence of the original infection. The patient and caregivers should know to report central nervous system symptoms (ataxia, mood and mental changes, clumsiness, ataxia, seizures), peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in hands or feet), and leukopenia (seer throat or fever).

**Lifestyle Management**

Many of the infections treated with metronidazole and tinidazole are sexually transmitted. Male or female condom usage may decrease transmittal of some, but not all, infections. Patients should be advised of the route of transmission and practices that promote transmittal of the infection. Concurrent treatment and refraining from sexual activity until the treatment is complete may be necessary to resolve the infection. Foreign travel and wilderness travel are other sources of exposure to *Giardia* and amoebae that should be considered in the history for diagnosing these conditions.
