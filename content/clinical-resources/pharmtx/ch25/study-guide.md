## Antiviral Agents

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning antiviral drugs must work inside host cells to be effective. This can lead to damage to host cells. Optimal treatment requires early initiation, as viral replication may peak before symptoms appear.

### Nucleoside Analogues (for Herpes & Varicella)

These drugs are primarily used to treat infections caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). They do not cure the infection but can shorten the duration and decrease severity.

- **Drugs:** Acyclovir (Zovirax), Valacyclovir (Valtrex), Famciclovir (Famvir).
- **Mechanism of Action (MOA):**
    - They are analogues that interfere with viral DNA synthesis and inhibit viral replication.
    - Acyclovir requires a virus-specific enzyme (thymidine kinase) for activation, making it selectively active in infected cells.
    - Valacyclovir is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to acyclovir, resulting in higher serum levels than oral acyclovir.
    - Famciclovir is a prodrug for penciclovir, which works similarly to acyclovir.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Acyclovir has poor oral bioavailability (15-20%).
    - Valacyclovir has 54% bioavailability as acyclovir.
    - All are eliminated primarily through the urine, requiring dose adjustments for patients with renal impairment.
- **Precautions & Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs):**
    > [!CAUTION]
    > **Renal failure** has been reported; cautious use and dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal impairment and in older adults. Maintain adequate hydration.
    - Common ADRs include headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
    - Neurological effects (e.g., confusion, tremor, seizures) can occur, especially in older adults and those with renal dysfunction.
- **Rational Drug Selection:**
    - All three have equal efficacy for genital herpes. Selection is based on cost and convenience.
    - Acyclovir is less expensive but requires more frequent dosing (3-5 times daily).
    - Valacyclovir and famciclovir offer less frequent dosing (1-2 times daily) but are more expensive.
    - Valacyclovir may be the drug of choice for herpes zoster in patients over 50, as it may decrease the duration of postherpetic neuralgia better than acyclovir.
- **Patient Education:**
    - Initiate therapy at the earliest sign of recurrence for maximum efficacy.
    - Maintain adequate hydration to prevent renal toxicity. Report any decrease in urination.
    - These drugs do not prevent the transmission of genital herpes. Sexual activity should be avoided when symptoms are present.

### Antivirals for COVID-19

These are recommended for outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for severe disease.

- **Preferred Drugs:** Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) and Remdesivir (Veklury).
- **Mechanism of Action (MOA):**
    - **Paxlovid:** Nirmatrelvir inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 protease to prevent viral replication. Ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor that boosts nirmatrelvir levels by inhibiting its metabolism via CYP3A.
    - **Remdesivir:** Inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is required for replication.
- **Pharmacotherapeutics:**
    > [!WARNING]
    > **Paxlovid:** Oral therapy started within 5 days of symptom onset for 5 days. It is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and has numerous significant drug interactions. Dose reduction is required for moderate renal impairment. A pharmacist should always be consulted regarding potential drug interactions.
    - **Remdesivir:** IV therapy administered over 3 days for outpatients.
    - Common ADRs for Paxlovid include dysgeusia (altered taste), diarrhea, and hypertension.
    - The most common ADR for Remdesivir is nausea.
- **Rational Drug Selection:**
    - Oral Paxlovid is the first-line outpatient treatment due to its ease of home administration.
    - Remdesivir is used for hospitalized patients or outpatients who cannot take oral medication.
- **Patient Education:**
    - Paxlovid tablets should not be chewed, broken, or crushed.
    - Patients should complete the full 5-day course.
    - Due to the high potential for drug interactions with Paxlovid, reiterate the importance of pharmacist consultation.

### Antivirals for Influenza

These are most effective when started within 48 hours of symptom onset. They do not replace the annual flu vaccine.

- **Drugs:** Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir (Relenza), Peramivir (Rapivab), Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza).
- **Mechanism of Action (MOA):**
    - Oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir are neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent the release of the virus from host cells.
    - Baloxavir inhibits a polymerase protein, which halts influenza virus replication.
- **Pharmacotherapeutics:**
    - **Oseltamivir:** Oral formulation; common ADRs are nausea and vomiting. Dose adjustment is needed for renal impairment.
    > [!CAUTION]
    > **Zanamivir:** Inhaled powder; may cause bronchospasm and should not be used in patients with underlying respiratory disease.
    - **Baloxavir:** Absorption is decreased by polyvalent cation-containing products (e.g., calcium, iron, antacids).
- **Patient Education:**
    - Stress the importance of taking the full course of therapy.
    - Teach proper use of the diskhaler for zanamivir.
    - The single most important factor in prevention is annual vaccination.

### Antivirals for Hepatitis C

Treatment has evolved to offer highly effective therapies that can eradicate the virus. Management is complex and should be done in consultation with a specialist.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All patients must be tested for current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before starting HCV antivirals due to a boxed warning for risk of HBV reactivation, which can be fatal.

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Most are fixed-dose combinations of drugs that inhibit different viral proteins necessary for replication (e.g., NS5A, NS5B, NS3/4A protease).
- **Common ADRs:** Headache, fatigue, and nausea are the most frequent adverse effects.
- **Drug Interactions:** These agents have numerous and complex drug interactions, particularly those metabolized by or inhibiting CYP3A4.

## Antifungal Agents

### Systemic Azoles and Terbinafine

Used for a wide range of fungal infections from superficial dermatophyte infections to invasive systemic mycoses.

- **Azoles:** Fluconazole (Diflucan), Itraconazole, Voriconazole.
- **Allylamine:** Terbinafine (Lamisil).
- **Mechanism of Action (MOA):**
    - **Azoles:** Inhibit a fungal CYP450 enzyme (14-a-demethylase), which reduces the production of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane.
    - **Terbinafine:** Interferes with ergosterol synthesis at an earlier step by inhibiting squalene epoxidase.
- **Precautions & ADRs:**
    > [!WARNING]
    > **Hepatotoxicity:** All systemic azoles and terbinafine have been associated with liver injury, ranging from elevated transaminases to liver failure. Liver function tests (AST, ALT) should be monitored.
    - **Drug Interactions:** Azoles are inhibitors of human CYP450 enzymes (especially CYP3A4), leading to many potential drug interactions. Terbinafine has fewer interactions.
    - **QT Prolongation:** All azoles may cause QT prolongation.
    - **Voriconazole:** Causes transient visual disturbances (flashes of light, color changes) in up to 19% of patients.
- **Rational Drug Selection:**
    - **Fluconazole:** Has reliable bioavailability, fewer drug interactions than other azoles, and is often preferred for mild-to-moderate systemic infections and vaginal candidiasis. It is available as a generic and is the most affordable azole.
    - **Terbinafine:** Is the recommended treatment for onychomycosis and tinea infections.
- **Patient Education:**
    - Report any signs of liver toxicity (fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pale stools) immediately.
    - Itraconazole *capsules* should be taken with food to improve absorption. The *solution* should be taken on an empty stomach.
    - Posaconazole should be taken with a high-fat meal.

## Anthelmintics

Used to treat parasitic worm infections (e.g., pinworm, roundworm, hookworm).

- **Drugs:** Mebendazole, Albendazole, Pyrantel Pamoate, Ivermectin.
- **Mechanism of Action (MOA):**
    - **Benzimidazoles (Albendazole, Mebendazole):** Inhibit microtubule function in the worm.
    - **Pyrantel Pamoate:** Acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, causing spastic paralysis in the worm.
    - **Ivermectin:** Binds to chloride ion channels in the parasite's nerve and muscle cells, causing hyperpolarization and paralysis.
- **Pharmacotherapeutics:**
    - Albendazole and mebendazole are associated with rare reports of bone marrow suppression and elevated liver enzymes.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Albendazole has demonstrated teratogenic effects in animals; women of childbearing age should have a negative pregnancy test before starting and use effective contraception for 1 month after therapy.
    - Pyrantel pamoate is available over-the-counter (OTC).
- **Patient Education:**
    - Albendazole and mebendazole should be taken with a high-fat meal to increase absorption.
    - Ivermectin should be taken on an empty stomach with a full glass of water.
    - For pinworm, simultaneous treatment of all household members and strict hygiene (cleaning linens, hand washing) are required for eradication.

## Metronidazole, Nitazoxanide, and Tinidazole

These agents are used to treat protozoal and certain bacterial infections.

- **Drugs:** Metronidazole (Flagyl), Tinidazole (Tindamax), Nitazoxanide (Alinia).
- **Indications:**
    - **Metronidazole/Tinidazole:** Bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and anaerobic bacterial infections. Metronidazole is also used for *C. difficile* infection.
    - **Nitazoxanide:** Diarrhea caused by *Giardia lamblia* and *Cryptosporidium parvum*.
- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Metronidazole and tinidazole are nitroimidazoles that disrupt DNA and protein synthesis in susceptible organisms.
- **Key Precautions & ADRs:**
    > [!WARNING]
    > **Disulfiram-like Reaction:** Patients taking metronidazole or tinidazole must **avoid all alcohol** during therapy and for 48-72 hours after completion to prevent severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.
    - Common ADRs for metronidazole include a metallic taste, nausea, headache, and dry mouth.
    - Seizures and peripheral neuropathy are infrequent but serious adverse reactions to metronidazole.
- **Drug Interactions:**
    - Metronidazole and tinidazole potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin; the INR should be closely monitored.
- **Patient Education:**
    - Take metronidazole and tinidazole with food to minimize GI irritation.
    - Nitazoxanide should be taken with food.
    - Metronidazole may cause a harmless darkening of the urine.
    - For sexually transmitted infections like trichomoniasis, both partners should be treated simultaneously to prevent reinfection.

## Clinical Pearls

This section summarizes key clinical takeaways for quick reference.

-   **General Antiviral Principle:** Early initiation of antiviral therapy is crucial, as viral replication often peaks before or concurrently with symptom onset.
-   **Nucleoside Analogues (Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir):** Always counsel on maintaining adequate hydration to prevent renal toxicity, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing renal impairment.
-   **Paxlovid (Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir):** This drug is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with numerous significant drug interactions. *Always* perform a thorough drug interaction review or consult a pharmacist before prescribing.
-   **Hepatitis C Direct-Acting Antivirals:** Prior to initiating therapy, screen all patients for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) due to the risk of HBV reactivation, which can be severe or fatal.
-   **Influenza Antivirals:** Most effective if started within 48 hours of symptom onset. They do not replace the annual influenza vaccine. Zanamivir (inhaled) is contraindicated in patients with underlying respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma, COPD) due to the risk of bronchospasm.
-   **Systemic Azoles (Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Voriconazole):**
    *   Risk of hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests (LFTs).
    *   Significant CYP450 enzyme inhibitors (especially CYP3A4): High potential for drug interactions.
    *   QT prolongation risk.
    *   Itraconazole *capsules* require food for absorption, while the *solution* should be taken on an empty stomach.
-   **Terbinafine:** Primarily used for onychomycosis and tinea infections. Also carries a risk of hepatotoxicity; monitor LFTs.
-   **Albendazole:** Teratogenic. Ensure a negative pregnancy test before starting in women of childbearing potential and advise effective contraception during and for one month after therapy.
-   **Metronidazole & Tinidazole:**
    *   Absolute alcohol avoidance is critical during therapy and for 48-72 hours after completion to prevent a disulfiram-like reaction.
    *   Potentiate warfarin; monitor INR closely.
-   **Pinworm Treatment:** Treat all household members simultaneously and emphasize strict hygiene measures to prevent reinfection and ensure eradication.
