## Key Concepts

This section will highlight the core principles and essential information for each major topic in Chapter 16.

### I. Principles of Immunization

*   **Goal of Vaccination:** To prevent infectious diseases through mass immunization of susceptible populations.
*   **Impact:** Vaccination is the single best technique for preventing infectious disease, leading to dramatic decreases in vaccine-preventable illnesses (e.g., diphtheria, *Haemophilus influenzae*, pertussis, hepatitis A).
*   **Consequences of Decreased Vaccination:** Resurgence of diseases like measles and polio can occur when vaccination programs are halted or rates decline.
*   **Types of Immunity:**
    *   **Active Immunity:** Develops in response to an infection or vaccination. Can be long-lasting.
    *   **Passive Immunity:** Acquired through the transfer of antibodies from one person to another (e.g., mother to infant, or through immunoglobulin products). Provides immediate but temporary protection.
*   **General Categories of Vaccines:**
    *   **Attenuated (Modified-Live) Vaccines:** Use a weakened form of the living germ. Examples include Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), Oral Polio (OPV - *not used in US*), Varicella, Yellow Fever, Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), Rotavirus, Zoster (Zostavax - *older version*), Cholera, Dengue, Ebola, Mpox, and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG).
        *   Typically produce a strong and long-lasting immune response, often with a single dose or few doses.
        *   Must replicate to be effective.
        *   Generally contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women due to risk of uncontrolled viral/bacterial replication.
    *   **Inactivated (Killed) Vaccines:** Use the killed version of the germ. Examples include COVID-19, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (DTaP, Tdap, etc.), *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib), Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Pneumococcal, Meningococcal, Inactivated Influenza Vaccine, Japanese Encephalitis, Plague, Rabies, and Zoster (Shingrix - *recombinant, preferred*).
        *   Cannot cause the disease they are designed to prevent.
        *   Usually require multiple doses (initial series + boosters) to build and maintain immunity.
        *   Generally considered safe for immunocompromised individuals, though immune response may be suboptimal.

### II. Specific Vaccines

This section details key information for commonly used vaccines, categorized by type.

#### A. Attenuated (Live) Vaccines

Attenuated vaccines use a weakened (attenuated) form of the germ that causes a disease. Because these vaccines are so similar to the natural infection that they help prevent, they create a strong and long-lasting immune response. Just 1 or 2 doses of most live vaccines can give you a lifetime of protection against a germ and the disease it causes.

##### 1. Influenza Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4; FluMist Quadrivalent)

*   **Disease Prevented:** Influenza (seasonal flu).
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Contains four live, attenuated influenza virus strains (two A, two B), which are cold-adapted (replicate in cooler nasal passages) and temperature-sensitive (do not replicate well at core body temperature).
*   **Administration:** Intranasal spray (half dose in each nostril).
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   History of severe allergic reaction to any component or previous dose.
    *   Children aged 2-4 years with asthma or a wheezing episode in the past 12 months.
    *   Children and adolescents (2-17 years) receiving aspirin or salicylate-containing therapies (risk of Reye syndrome).
    *   Immunocompromised individuals (due to illness or medications).
    *   Close contacts and caregivers of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment.
    *   Pregnancy.
    *   Receipt of influenza antiviral medications within the previous 48 hours (oseltamivir/zanamivir), 5 days (peramivir), or 17 days (baloxavir).
    *   Anatomical conditions predisposing to aspiration (e.g., cochlear implant - check specific recommendations, CSF leaks).
*   **Adverse Reactions:** Runny nose/nasal congestion, headache, sore throat, cough, muscle aches. Generally mild and transient.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Influenza antiviral medications can interfere with LAIV efficacy.
    *   Aspirin/salicylates in children/adolescents (contraindicated).
    *   Can be given with other live or inactivated vaccines on the same day. If not given on the same day, separate from other live vaccines by at least 4 weeks.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   Approved for healthy, non-pregnant individuals aged 2 through 49 years.
    *   Annual vaccination: 0.2 mL (0.1 mL per nostril).
    *   Children aged 2-8 years receiving influenza vaccine for the first time (or who have not previously received ≥2 doses of any influenza vaccine) require two doses, separated by at least 4 weeks.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Inform about common side effects (nasal congestion, runny nose, headache).
    *   Advise that viral shedding may occur for a short period; theoretical risk of transmission to severely immunocompromised contacts (avoid close contact for ~7 days if feasible).
    *   Explain it cannot cause flu because viruses are attenuated and temperature-sensitive.

##### 2. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine (e.g., M-M-R II, PRIORIX)

*   **Diseases Prevented:** Measles, Mumps, Rubella.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Contains live, attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella viruses. Induces a subclinical, non-contagious infection stimulating antibody production.
*   **Administration:** Subcutaneous (SC).
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   History of anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of MMR vaccine or to vaccine components (e.g., neomycin, gelatin - note: PRIORIX does not contain gelatin).
    *   Severe immunodeficiency (e.g., from hematologic/solid tumors, congenital immunodeficiency, long-term immunosuppressive therapy including high-dose corticosteroids). HIV-infected individuals without severe immunosuppression can receive MMR.
    *   Pregnancy (women should avoid pregnancy for 1 month post-vaccination).
    *   Moderate or severe acute illness (defer until recovery).
    *   Recent (within 3-11 months, depending on product/dose) receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e.g., immunoglobulin, blood transfusion) as this can interfere with vaccine efficacy.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   Common: Fever (5-15%, typically 7-12 days post-vaccination), transient rash (5%).
    *   Less common: Febrile seizures (1 per 3,000-4,000 doses, risk highest 6-14 days post-vaccination), transient thrombocytopenia (rare, ~1 per 30,000-40,000 doses).
    *   Joint symptoms (arthralgia, arthritis) can occur in susceptible individuals (especially adult women after rubella component), usually transient.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Immunosuppressive drugs (including high-dose corticosteroids) can reduce vaccine effectiveness and increase risk of disseminated infection.
    *   Antibody-containing blood products (IG) can interfere with immune response; specific timing intervals for administration are crucial.
    *   May temporarily suppress tuberculin skin test (PPD) reactivity; if PPD needed, administer on same day as MMR or 4-6 weeks later.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   Routine schedule: Two doses - first at 12-15 months, second at 4-6 years.
    *   Infants <12 months in outbreak settings: May receive a dose, but this dose does not count towards the routine 2-dose series; revaccinate at 12-15 months and again at 4-6 years.
    *   Adults born in 1957 or later without evidence of immunity: At least one dose. Certain groups (e.g., healthcare personnel, students, international travelers) need two doses separated by at least 28 days.
    *   Mumps outbreak settings: A third dose may be recommended.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Inform about common side effects like fever and rash, and their typical timing.
    *   Discuss the low risk of febrile seizures and thrombocytopenia.
    *   Advise women of childbearing age to avoid pregnancy for 1 month after vaccination.
    *   Explain that the vaccine viruses are attenuated and do not cause transmission.

##### 3. Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (MMRV) Vaccine (ProQuad)

*   **Diseases Prevented:** Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (chickenpox).
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Contains live, attenuated measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. Produces a subclinical infection, creating active immunity.
*   **Administration:** Subcutaneous (SC).
    *   Response rate (after 1st dose at 6 weeks): Varicella 91.2%, Measles 97.4%, Mumps 98.8%, Rubella 98.5%. >99% immunity to all four after two doses.
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   Similar to MMR: History of anaphylactic reaction to neomycin, gelatin, or other components; severe immunodeficiency; pregnancy (avoid for 3 months post-vaccination); moderate/severe acute illness; recent antibody-containing blood products.
    *   **Febrile Seizures:** Increased risk with the first dose of MMRV compared to separate MMR and Varicella vaccines in children 12-23 months. Use with caution in children with a history of seizures or conditions where fever-induced stress should be avoided.
    *   Untreated active tuberculosis.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   Higher incidence of fever (≥102°F/39°C) compared to separate MMR and Varicella: 21.5% with MMRV vs. 14.9% with MMR + Varicella (first dose).
    *   **Febrile Seizures:** One additional febrile seizure per 2,300-2,600 children aged 12-23 months receiving their first dose of MMRV (5-12 days post-vaccination) compared to separate injections. This increased risk is not seen with the second dose.
    *   Slightly increased risk of measles-like rash (3% with MMRV vs. 2.1% with MMR).
    *   Injection site reactions: Pain (22%), erythema (14.4%), swelling (8.4%).
    *   Risk of thrombocytopenia (as with MMR).
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Similar to MMR: Immunosuppressants, antibody-containing blood products (avoid MMRV for 3 months after IG/transfusion), PPD test timing.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   Indicated for children 12 months through 12 years of age.
    *   Routine schedule: Can be used for either the first dose (12-15 months) or second dose (4-6 years) of MMR and Varicella.
    *   **CDC Recommendation:** For the first dose in children 12-47 months, it is preferred to administer MMR and Varicella vaccines separately due to the lower risk of febrile seizures. MMRV is an option if parents/providers prefer fewer injections.
    *   For the second dose (at any age between 15 months and 12 years), or the first dose for children 48 months to 12 years, MMRV is generally preferred over separate injections.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Inform parents about the increased risk of fever and febrile seizures with the first dose of MMRV compared to separate MMR and Varicella vaccines, and the typical timing (5-12 days post-vaccination).
    *   Discuss common side effects like rash and injection site reactions.
    *   Advise women of childbearing potential to avoid pregnancy for 3 months after vaccination.

##### 4. Rotavirus Vaccine (RotaTeq RV5, Rotarix RV1)

*   **Disease Prevented:** Rotavirus gastroenteritis (a leading cause of severe diarrhea and vomiting in infants and young children).
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Live, oral vaccines (RotaTeq contains five human-bovine reassortant rotavirus strains; Rotarix contains one human rotavirus strain). They replicate in the small intestine to induce active immunity.
*   **Administration:** Oral.
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose or to any component of the vaccine.
    *   Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID).
    *   History of intussusception (a type of bowel blockage).
    *   Infants who are or may be immunocompromised (e.g., due to blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphoma, HIV/AIDS, immunosuppressive therapy).
    *   Delay administration in infants with moderate or severe acute illness (e.g., febrile illness, acute gastroenteritis) until recovery.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Intussusception:** A small increased risk (approx. 1-1.5 cases per 100,000 vaccinated infants) primarily within 7 days after the first dose.
    *   **RotaTeq (RV5):** Slight increase in vomiting and diarrhea compared to placebo in clinical trials.
    *   **Rotarix (RV1):** Slight increase in vomiting compared to placebo in clinical trials. No significant increase in fever, diarrhea, or fussiness.
    *   Irritability (no significant difference from placebo for RotaTeq).
    *   Viral shedding in stool can occur (approx. 8.9% with RotaTeq); good hygiene is important.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Can be administered concurrently with other routine childhood vaccines (DTaP, IPV, Hib, Hepatitis B, PCV).
    *   Can be administered before, after, or concurrently with blood products or immunoglobulin.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **RotaTeq (RV5):** 3-dose oral series. First dose at 6-12 weeks of age. Subsequent doses at 4-10 week intervals. All doses should be completed by 32 weeks of age. Maximum age for first dose: 14 weeks, 6 days.
    *   **Rotarix (RV1):** 2-dose oral series. First dose at 6 weeks of age. Second dose at least 4 weeks after the first, and both doses by 24 weeks of age. Maximum age for first dose: 14 weeks, 6 days.
    *   The series should be completed with the same product if possible. If product used for previous doses is unknown or unavailable, continue/complete series with product available.
    *   If an infant regurgitates, spits out, or vomits a dose, do not re-administer that dose. Continue with the next scheduled dose.
    *   Infants who have had rotavirus gastroenteritis before completing the series should still start or complete the series on schedule.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Inform parents about the signs and symptoms of intussusception (e.g., severe abdominal pain, inconsolable crying, drawing legs up to abdomen, vomiting, bloody stools) and instruct them to seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
    *   Explain that the vaccine is given orally.
    *   Advise about potential mild, temporary side effects like vomiting or diarrhea.
    *   Emphasize good handwashing as the virus can be shed in the stool.
    *   Instruct parents to report any concerning adverse reactions.

##### 5. Varicella Virus Vaccine (Varivax)

*   **Disease Prevented:** Varicella (Chickenpox).
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine. Induces both humoral (IgG antibody) and cell-mediated immunity.
    *   Efficacy (2-dose): ~98% against any disease, prevents severe disease even if mild breakthrough infection occurs.
*   **Administration:** Subcutaneous (SC).
    *   Seroconversion: ~86% after 1st dose in children; >99% after 2nd dose in children; ~78-82% after 1st dose in adults, 99% after 2nd dose.
*   **Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Effective if given within 3 days of exposure (90% effective in preventing varicella, 100% in decreasing severity); 70% effective if given within 5 days.
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   History of anaphylactic reaction to neomycin, gelatin, or other vaccine components.
    *   Moderate or severe acute illness.
    *   Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, symptomatic HIV, those on high-dose corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy).
        *   Asymptomatic HIV-infected children with adequate CD4+ counts may be considered.
    *   Pregnancy (avoid pregnancy for 1-3 months post-vaccination).
    *   Active untreated tuberculosis.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   Common: Fever (~15% in children), injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling ~24%).
    *   Vesicular rash: Localized at injection site (3-4%), or generalized (3-6%, typically <5 lesions, mild). Occurs within 48 days.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Immunosuppressants (including high-dose corticosteroids for ≥14 days) can reduce effectiveness and increase risk of disseminated disease. Wait 4 weeks after stopping high-dose steroids.
    *   Antibody-containing blood products (e.g., IG) can interfere with immune response. Avoid vaccine for 3-11 months after IG, and avoid IG for 2 weeks (CDC) to 2 months (manufacturer) after vaccine.
    *   Salicylates (e.g., aspirin): Manufacturer recommends avoidance for 6 weeks post-vaccination due to theoretical risk of Reye syndrome (though not reported).
    *   Can be given with MMR on the same day (separate sites/needles) or as MMRV. If not given same day as other live vaccines, separate by at least 4 weeks.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **Children (12 months - 12 years):** Two doses. First dose at 12-15 months. Second dose at 4-6 years. Minimum interval 3 months.
    *   **Adolescents (≥13 years) and Adults without evidence of immunity:** Two doses, 4-8 weeks apart.
    *   Screening for immunity in adults before vaccination is optional and may be cost-effective.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Inform about common side effects: fever, injection site reactions, and the possibility of a mild rash (localized or generalized).
    *   If a rash develops, advise avoiding contact with immunocompromised individuals for the duration of the rash (though transmission risk is very low).
    *   Advise women of childbearing potential to avoid pregnancy for 1-3 months after vaccination.
    *   Explain the importance of completing the two-dose series for optimal protection.

##### 6. Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL, Zostavax)

*   **Disease Prevented:** Herpes Zoster (Shingles).
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (Oka/Merck strain, same as Varivax but higher titer). Aims to boost VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity to prevent reactivation.
    *   Efficacy: ~70% (ages 50-59), ~64% (ages 60-69), ~38% (ages ≥70). Effectiveness decreases significantly over time (e.g., <35% by 6 years post-vaccination).
    *   **Note:** The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) preferentially recommends the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) due to its higher and more sustained efficacy. ZVL may still be used in certain situations for immunocompetent adults ≥60 years if RZV is contraindicated or unavailable, but RZV is generally preferred.
*   **Administration:** Subcutaneous (SC), single dose.
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   History of anaphylactic reaction to neomycin, gelatin, or other vaccine components.
    *   Primary or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, bone marrow/lymphatic cancers, AIDS, or other conditions associated with immunosuppression).
    *   Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., ≥20 mg/day of prednisone for ≥2 weeks); wait at least 1 month after discontinuation.
    *   Active, untreated tuberculosis.
    *   Pregnancy (not indicated for women of childbearing age).
    *   Moderate or severe acute illness.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   Common: Injection site reactions (erythema ~34%, pain/tenderness ~33%, swelling ~24%, pruritus ~7%).
    *   Headache (~1.4%).
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Antiviral medications active against herpesviruses (e.g., acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir) should be discontinued at least 24 hours before ZVL administration and not resumed for at least 14 days after vaccination.
    *   High-dose corticosteroids (contraindicated).
    *   Can be given with blood products/IG.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   Single 0.65 mL SC dose.
    *   ACIP recommends for immunocompetent adults ≥60 years, but RZV (Shingrix) is preferred for adults ≥50 years.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Inform about common injection site reactions and headache.
    *   Discuss that while ZVL can reduce the risk of shingles, the newer recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) is generally preferred due to higher and longer-lasting protection and will be discussed separately.

##### 13. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Vaccine

*   **Disease Prevented:** Primarily severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) in children, such as miliary TB and TB meningitis. Less effective against adult pulmonary TB.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Live, attenuated strain of *Mycobacterium bovis*. Induces cell-mediated immunity. Protection is variable and can last up to 10-15 years, possibly longer.
*   **Administration:** Intradermal (ID) injection, typically over the deltoid.
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   **Immunocompromised individuals:** Including HIV infection (especially symptomatic or with low CD4 counts), congenital immunodeficiencies, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or those on high-dose corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy (risk of disseminated BCG infection).
    *   **Pregnancy:** Generally contraindicated, though may be considered in high-risk situations if benefits outweigh risks.
    *   **Active TB disease:** BCG is not a treatment for active TB.
    *   Individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST/PPD) or Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA), unless it's determined they would benefit from vaccination (rare in low-incidence settings).
    *   Certain skin conditions at the site of injection.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Expected Local Reaction:** A papule typically forms 2-6 weeks after vaccination, which may progress to a shallow ulcer that heals over several weeks to months, leaving a characteristic scar. This is a normal response.
    *   **Regional Lymphadenopathy:** Swelling of lymph nodes near the vaccination site (e.g., axillary) is common and usually resolves spontaneously.
    *   **Serious (Rare):**
        *   Suppurative lymphadenitis (lymph nodes may drain pus).
        *   Osteitis or osteomyelitis (inflammation of bone).
        *   Disseminated BCG infection (BCG-itis): Potentially life-threatening, especially in immunocompromised individuals.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Immunosuppressive medications (contraindicated or reduce efficacy).
    *   Antituberculosis drugs (may interfere if given for active disease, but BCG is preventative).
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **Not routinely recommended in the U.S.** due to low TB incidence and interference with TST/PPD interpretation.
    *   Primarily used in countries with high TB prevalence for infants and young children, usually given shortly after birth.
    *   May be considered in the U.S. for select infants, children, or healthcare workers who are at very high risk of TB exposure (e.g., unavoidable exposure to MDR-TB) and after consultation with TB experts.
    *   **Dose:** Single ID injection. Dose volume varies by product and age (e.g., 0.05 mL for infants <12 months, 0.1 mL for older children/adults for some strains).
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Explain the expected local skin reaction (papule -> ulcer -> scar) and its timeline. This is normal and indicates the vaccine is working.
    *   Advise on keeping the vaccination site clean and dry. Avoid occlusive dressings.
    *   Inform about possible regional lymph node swelling, which is usually benign.
    *   **Crucially, explain that BCG vaccination can cause a positive TST/PPD result.** This means future TB screening may require IGRA blood tests or careful interpretation of TST results.
    *   Discuss the vaccine's role in preventing severe TB in children in high-risk settings.
    *   Report any severe local reactions, persistent draining, or systemic symptoms to a healthcare provider.

#### B. Inactivated Vaccines

This section covers inactivated (killed) vaccines and other non-live vaccine types (e.g., subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, conjugate, toxoid, mRNA, viral vector). These vaccines contain pathogens that have been inactivated, or specific components of pathogens, making them unable to cause disease but still capable of stimulating an immune response. They typically require multiple doses and may need boosters to maintain immunity.

Key characteristics often include:
*   Cannot cause the disease they are protecting against.
*   Generally considered safe for immunocompromised individuals (though immune response may be suboptimal).
*   Often require adjuvants to enhance the immune response.
*   Usually more stable than live vaccines.
*   May require booster doses for long-term protection.

##### 1. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna)

*   **Disease Prevented:** Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** These vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for delivery into host cells. Host cells translate the mRNA into S protein, which is then displayed on the cell surface, eliciting an immune response (both humoral and cellular) against the S protein. This prepares the immune system to recognize and fight the actual virus if encountered. Bivalent vaccines include mRNA for both the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and an Omicron variant (e.g., BA.4/BA.5) to broaden protection.
*   **Administration:** Intramuscular (IM).
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any COVID-19 mRNA vaccine or to any of its components (including polyethylene glycol - PEG, and tromethamine in some formulations).
    *   History of myocarditis or pericarditis after a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (requires careful consideration and discussion with a healthcare provider; may be a precaution rather than an absolute contraindication for future doses, depending on severity and specific guidance).
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common:** Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), fatigue, headache, myalgia, chills, arthralgia, fever, lymphadenopathy (especially axillary).
    *   **Serious (Rare):**
        *   Anaphylaxis.
        *   Myocarditis and/or pericarditis: Inflammation of the heart muscle or surrounding tissue. Higher risk in adolescent and young adult males, typically within a week after the second dose. Most cases are mild and resolve, but requires medical evaluation.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Immunosuppressive therapies may reduce vaccine efficacy. Current recommendations generally support vaccination of immunocompromised individuals, often with additional doses.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **Indication:** For active immunization to prevent COVID-19. Specific age indications vary by product and current public health recommendations (e.g., for individuals 6 months of age and older).
    *   **Primary Series:** Typically 2 doses (e.g., 3-8 weeks apart depending on product and age).
    *   **Booster Doses:** Recommended for many individuals to enhance and broaden immunity, especially against newer variants. Specific recommendations for bivalent boosters and additional boosters for certain populations (e.g., older adults, immunocompromised) evolve based on CDC/ACIP guidance.
    *   Dose volumes and specific formulations vary by age group and product.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide CDC VIS or EUA Fact Sheet.
    *   Explain the dosing schedule, including the importance of completing the primary series and recommended boosters.
    *   Inform about common side effects and advise on management (e.g., rest, fluids, antipyretics/analgesics if needed after vaccination).
    *   **Crucially, educate on the signs and symptoms of myocarditis/pericarditis** (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations) and instruct to seek immediate medical attention if they occur, especially within a week after vaccination.
    *   Discuss the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19.
    *   Advise that it takes about 2 weeks after completing the primary series (or after a booster) for the body to build maximum protection.

##### 2. COVID-19 Protein Subunit Vaccine (Novavax, Adjuvanted)

*   **Disease Prevented:** Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** This is a recombinant protein subunit vaccine. It contains purified, laboratory-made SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. It also contains the Matrix-M adjuvant, which helps stimulate a stronger immune response. The body recognizes the S protein as foreign and mounts an immune response (primarily humoral) against it.
*   **Administration:** Intramuscular (IM).
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine or to any of its components (e.g., polysorbate 80).
    *   History of myocarditis or pericarditis after a previous dose of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (requires careful consideration; may be a precaution).
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common:** Injection site reactions (tenderness, pain, redness, swelling), fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, fever, chills.
    *   **Serious (Rare):**
        *   Anaphylaxis.
        *   Myocarditis and/or pericarditis: Observed in clinical trials and post-authorization. Risk appears low.
*   **Drug Interactions:**

    *   Discuss signs of more serious reactions (e.g., high fever, persistent inconsolable crying, seizures, signs of allergic reaction) and when to seek medical attention.
    *   Reinforce the importance of pertussis vaccination for adolescents and adults to protect infants too young to be fully vaccinated (cocooning strategy).
    *   For tetanus, explain the need for boosters every 10 years or for wound management.

##### 4. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Conjugate Vaccine

*   **Disease Prevented:** Invasive diseases caused by *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib), including meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and bacteremia.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Contains Hib capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate - PRP) covalently linked (conjugated) to a carrier protein (e.g., tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or an outer membrane protein complex of *Neisseria meningitidis*). This conjugation converts the T-independent polysaccharide antigen into a T-dependent antigen, eliciting a more robust and long-lasting immune response, especially in infants.
*   **Administration:** Intramuscular (IM).
*   **Formulations:** Available as single-antigen vaccines (e.g., ActHIB®, Hiberix®, PedvaxHIB®) or in combination vaccines (e.g., DTaP-IPV/Hib - Pentacel®; DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB - Vaxelis®; Hib-MenCY - MenHibrix®).
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   **Contraindication:** Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of Hib vaccine or to any vaccine component (including the carrier protein if known, e.g., tetanus toxoid for some formulations).

        *   HIV infection: 1 dose (if not previously vaccinated as child).
        *   Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients: 3-dose series starting 6–12 months post-transplant, with doses separated by at least 4 weeks.
        *   Chemotherapy or radiation therapy: 1 dose if not previously vaccinated.
    *   **Interchangeability:** Hib conjugate vaccines are interchangeable for the primary series and booster dose.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide CDC VIS.
    *   Explain the routine vaccination schedule and the importance of completing the series for full protection against serious Hib diseases like meningitis.
    *   Inform about common side effects: mild local reactions (redness, swelling, pain at injection site) and low-grade fever. Advise on comfort measures.
    *   Discuss signs of more serious reactions (e.g., high fever, persistent crying, signs of allergic reaction) and when to seek medical attention.
    *   Reassure parents that Hib vaccine does not cause influenza (the flu).

##### 5. Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV)

*   **Disease Prevented:** Poliomyelitis (Polio) caused by poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Contains formalin-inactivated (killed) Mahoney (type 1), MEF-1 (type 2), and Saukett (type 3) strains of poliovirus. The enhanced-potency IPV (eIPV) used in the US is highly immunogenic, inducing humoral immunity (circulating antibodies) that prevents poliovirus from invading the central nervous system and causing paralysis. It also induces some local immunity in the gut.
*   **Administration:** Intramuscular (IM) or Subcutaneous (SC), depending on the specific product (IM is common for combination vaccines).
*   **Formulations:** Available as a standalone vaccine (e.g., Ipol®) or in combination vaccines (e.g., DTaP-HepB-IPV - Pediarix®; DTaP-IPV/Hib - Pentacel®; DTaP-IPV - Kinrix®, Quadracel®).
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   **Contraindication:** Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of IPV or to any vaccine component (e.g., neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B, which are used in its manufacture).
    *   **Precaution:** Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (defer vaccination until illness improves).
    *   Pregnancy: IPV can be given to pregnant individuals if indicated (e.g., increased risk of exposure), though routine vaccination is not typically recommended during pregnancy unless essential.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common:** Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling) are the most common. Fever (low-grade) may occur.
    *   **Rare:** Allergic reactions.
    *   IPV cannot cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) because it contains killed viruses. VAPP was a rare risk associated with the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), which is no longer used in the U.S.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Immunosuppressive therapies may reduce vaccine efficacy. If IPV is essential, it can be given, but revaccination may be considered after immunosuppressive therapy is discontinued (e.g., 3 months later).
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **Routine Infant/Childhood Schedule (All-IPV Series):** A 4-dose series at:
        *   Dose 1: 2 months of age
        *   Dose 2: 4 months of age
        *   Dose 3: 6–18 months of age
        *   Dose 4: 4–6 years of age (booster dose)
    *   **Minimum Intervals:** 4 weeks between doses 1 & 2, and 2 & 3. At least 6 months between dose 3 & 4. The final dose should be given on or after the 4th birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose.
    *   **Catch-up Vaccination:** Follow ACIP catch-up schedules. The number of doses depends on current age and number of doses previously received. Ensure final dose is on or after 4th birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose.
    *   **Adults:** Adults who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated and are at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus (e.g., travelers to polio-endemic regions, laboratory workers handling poliovirus) should complete a primary series (3 doses: 0, 1–2 months, 6–12 months after 2nd dose). If an adult has received a primary series previously, a one-time lifetime booster dose can be given if at increased risk.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide CDC VIS.
    *   Explain the routine vaccination schedule and the importance of completing the 4-dose series for lifelong protection against polio.
    *   Inform about common side effects: most commonly, soreness or redness at the injection site. Fever is uncommon.
    *   Emphasize that IPV is very safe and cannot cause polio.
    *   Discuss signs of a severe allergic reaction (rare) and when to seek immediate medical attention.
    *   Inform travelers to areas where polio is still present about the importance of being fully vaccinated.

##### 6. Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) Vaccine

*   **Disease Prevented:** Hepatitis A, an acute liver infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV).
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Contains formalin-inactivated Hepatitis A virus. Induces production of neutralizing antibodies against HAV, providing active immunity.
*   **Administration:** Intramuscular (IM) injection, typically in the deltoid muscle for adults and older children; anterolateral thigh for younger children.
*   **Formulations:**
    *   Single-antigen vaccines: Havrix®, Vaqta®.
    *   Combination vaccine (Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B): Twinrix®.
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   **Contraindication:** History of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of Hepatitis A vaccine or to any vaccine component (e.g., alum, 2-phenoxyethanol for some formulations).
    *   **Precaution:** Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (defer vaccination until illness improves).
    *   Pregnancy: Can be administered if the benefits of vaccination are considered to outweigh potential risks (e.g., travel to endemic area, during outbreaks). Data on safety in pregnancy are limited but reassuring.
    *   Immunocompromised persons: May have a diminished immune response. The usual schedule is recommended.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common:** Injection site reactions (soreness, redness, swelling), headache, malaise/fatigue.
    *   **Less Common:** Low-grade fever, nausea.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Immunosuppressive therapies may reduce vaccine efficacy.
    *   Can be administered concurrently with other inactivated or live vaccines at different injection sites.
    *   If Immune Globulin (IG) is also indicated (e.g., for post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals), Hepatitis A vaccine and IG can be given simultaneously at different sites. Co-administration may slightly reduce the peak antibody response to the vaccine, but clinical significance is likely minimal.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **Routine Childhood Vaccination:**
        *   All children aged 12–23 months: 2-dose series.
        *   Dose 1: At 12–23 months.
        *   Dose 2: 6–18 months after the first dose.
        *   Children who have not previously received Hepatitis A vaccine can be vaccinated at any age through 18 years.
    *   **Adult Dosing (Havrix® - 1440 EL.U./1.0 mL; Vaqta® - 50U/1.0 mL):**
        *   2-dose series: Dose 1 at 0 months, Dose 2 at 6–12 months (Havrix) or 6–18 months (Vaqta).
    *   **Combination Vaccine (Twinrix® - Hepatitis A [720 EL.U.] and Hepatitis B [20 mcg]):**
        *   Adults (≥18 years): 3-dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months.
        *   Accelerated schedule: 3 doses at 0, 7, and 21–30 days, followed by a booster dose at 12 months.
    *   **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):**
        *   For unvaccinated individuals exposed to HAV within the last 14 days:
            *   Healthy persons aged 12 months–40 years: Single dose of Hepatitis A vaccine.
            *   Adults >40 years: Single dose of Hepatitis A vaccine; Immune Globulin (IG, 0.1 mL/kg) can also be considered, especially if vaccine is contraindicated or if co-morbidities exist (e.g., chronic liver disease). If both are given, administer at different sites.
            *   Immunocompromised persons or those with chronic liver disease aged ≥12 months: Single dose of Hepatitis A vaccine AND Immune Globulin (0.1 mL/kg) simultaneously at different sites.
            *   Infants <12 months: Immune Globulin (0.1 mL/kg) instead of vaccine.
    *   **Vaccination for Persons at Increased Risk:** (2-dose series recommended)
        *   Travelers to countries with high or intermediate endemicity of HAV (vaccinate ≥2-4 weeks before travel if possible; even a single dose before travel provides some protection).
        *   Men who have sex with men.
        *   Persons who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs.
        *   Persons with occupational risk (e.g., working with HAV-infected primates or HAV in research labs).
        *   Persons with chronic liver disease (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease).
        *   Persons experiencing homelessness.
        *   Persons with clotting factor disorders who receive plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates.
        *   Close personal contacts (e.g., household, sexual) of adopted children newly arriving from countries with high or intermediate HAV endemicity.
        *   HIV-positive individuals (if not otherwise immune).
        *   Pregnant women identified to be at risk for HAV infection during pregnancy (e.g., international travel, illicit drug use, occupational exposure, close contact with an HAV-infected person) or for an HAV-related outcome (e.g., chronic liver disease).
    *   **Infant Travelers (6–11 months):** If traveling to areas with high or intermediate HAV endemicity, infants can receive 1 dose of Hepatitis A vaccine. This dose does not count toward the routine 2-dose series, which should be initiated at age 12 months according to the standard schedule.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide CDC VIS.
    *   Explain the 2-dose schedule and the importance of completing the series for long-term protection.
    *   Inform about common side effects: soreness and redness at the injection site are most common; headache or fatigue may also occur.
    *   Advise that severe reactions are rare, but discuss signs of allergic reaction and when to seek medical attention.
    *   Emphasize the importance of vaccination for travelers to certain countries and for individuals in high-risk groups.
    *   Reinforce messages about safe food and water precautions when traveling to endemic areas, even if vaccinated.

##### 7. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Vaccine

*   **Disease Prevented:** Hepatitis B, a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), which can lead to acute illness, chronic infection, cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, and death.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Contains recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) produced in yeast cells. Induces production of neutralizing anti-HBs antibodies, conferring active immunity. A protective antibody level is generally considered anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL.
*   **Administration:** Intramuscular (IM) injection. For infants and young children, the anterolateral thigh is preferred; for older children and adults, the deltoid muscle is preferred.
*   **Formulations:**
    *   Single-antigen vaccines: Engerix-B®, Recombivax HB®, Heplisav-B® (contains a CpG 1018 adjuvant, for adults ≥18 years).
    *   Combination vaccines: Pediarix® (DTaP-HepB-IPV), Vaxelis® (DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB), Twinrix® (Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B).
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   **Contraindication:** History of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of Hepatitis B vaccine, or to any vaccine component, including yeast (as HBsAg is produced in yeast).
    *   **Precaution:** Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (defer vaccination until illness improves).
    *   Pregnancy: Not contraindicated. Recommended for pregnant women at risk for HBV infection.
    *   Preterm infants weighing <2,000 grams born to HBsAg-negative mothers: Delay the first dose until 1 month of chronological age or hospital discharge (whichever is first), even if >2,000g by then. If born to HBsAg-positive mothers, administer HBV vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth, regardless of birth weight.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common:** Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), fever (low-grade).
    *   **Less Common/Rare:** Fatigue, headache, irritability. Anaphylaxis is rare. No evidence supports a causal association between HBV vaccine and autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids) may reduce the immune response to the vaccine. Higher vaccine doses or additional doses may be needed. Serologic testing for anti-HBs is recommended for immunocompromised persons to assess vaccine response.
    *   Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG): If administered concurrently with HBV vaccine (e.g., for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers or for postexposure prophylaxis), use separate injection sites.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **Routine Infant Vaccination (3-dose series for Engerix-B, Recombivax HB; or as part of combination vaccines like Pediarix, Vaxelis):**
        *   Dose 1: At birth (preferably before hospital discharge).
        *   Dose 2: At 1–2 months of age.
        *   Dose 3: At 6–18 months of age (final dose should not be given before 24 weeks of age).
        *   Minimum interval: 4 weeks between dose 1 and 2; 8 weeks between dose 2 and 3; 16 weeks between dose 1 and 3.
    *   **Catch-Up Vaccination (Children and Adolescents <19 years not previously vaccinated):**
        *   Standard 3-dose series: 0, 1–2 months, 4–6 months after dose 2 (but at least 16 weeks after dose 1).
    *   **Adult Vaccination (≥19 years):**
        *   **Engerix-B, Recombivax HB (3-dose series):** 0, 1, and 6 months.
        *   **Heplisav-B (2-dose series, for adults ≥18 years):** 0 and 1 month (doses separated by at least 4 weeks).
        *   **Twinrix (HepA/HepB, for adults ≥18 years):** 3-dose series at 0, 1, 6 months; or accelerated 4-dose schedule at 0, 7, 21-30 days, plus a booster at 12 months.
    *   **Special Populations/Situations:**
        *   **Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers:** Administer HBV vaccine AND Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG, 0.5 mL) within 12 hours of birth (at separate sites). Complete the vaccine series according to schedule. Perform post-vaccination serologic testing (PVST) for HBsAg and anti-HBs at 9–12 months of age.
        *   **Infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status:** Administer HBV vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Determine maternal HBsAg status ASAP. If mother is HBsAg-positive, administer HBIG to infant as soon as possible (no later than 7 days of age).
        *   **Hemodialysis patients and other immunocompromised persons:** May require higher doses (e.g., double the standard adult dose for Engerix-B or Recombivax HB) or more doses. Heplisav-B is an option for adults on hemodialysis. Serologic testing for anti-HBs is recommended 1–2 months after completing the series to assess for response; revaccinate non-responders (anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL).
        *   **Non-responders (anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL after a primary series):** Complete a second 3-dose series. Retest 1–2 months after the second series. If still no response, consider as susceptible; counsel on HBV prevention.
    *   **Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure to HBsAg-positive blood/body fluids:** Management depends on the exposed person's vaccination status and anti-HBs response. May involve HBIG and/or HBV vaccine.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide CDC VIS.
    *   Explain the importance of completing the multi-dose series for long-term protection against a serious liver disease.
    *   Inform about common side effects: soreness at the injection site is the most common. Mild systemic symptoms like fever or fatigue can occur but are usually transient.
    *   Advise on comfort measures (e.g., cool compress to site, antipyretics if needed for fever *after* vaccination).
    *   Discuss signs of a severe allergic reaction (rare) and when to seek immediate medical attention.
    *   For infants, explain the birth dose is crucial for preventing mother-to-child transmission.
    *   Reinforce that HBV vaccine does not cause hepatitis B infection.
    *   Ensure proper documentation: provide VIS (note date/edition), record vaccine lot number and administration site, document in immunization registry, note maternal HBsAg status for infants, and record any adverse reactions.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Pre-vaccination Testing:**
        *   Not routinely indicated for children or adolescents.
        *   Consider for high-risk adults (e.g., IV drug users, men who have sex with men, household contacts of HBV carriers).
    *   **Post-vaccination Serology:**
        *   Not routinely needed for the general population.
        *   Recommended 1–2 months after the final dose for: healthcare workers at risk of needlestick injuries, persons with HIV infection, hemodialysis patients, other immunocompromised patients at risk of HBV, regular sexual contacts of HBV carriers, and infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.
        *   Target: Anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL.

##### 8. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine

*   **Disease Prevented:** Infections and cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers, as well as anogenital warts.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:**
    *   **Vaccine Type:** Gardasil 9 (HPV9) is a nonavalent vaccine targeting HPV types 6, 11 (low-risk, cause genital warts) and 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 (high-risk, oncogenic types).
    *   **Mechanism:** Contains virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid protein L1 from the targeted HPV types. VLPs are non-infectious (no viral DNA) and induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies.
    *   **Important Note:** HPV vaccines are prophylactic; they do not treat existing HPV infections, HPV-related diseases, or cancers.
    *   **Efficacy:** High efficacy (approaching 100%) against infection and cervical precancers caused by vaccine-targeted HPV types in individuals not previously infected with those types.
*   **Administration:** Intramuscular (IM) injection, typically in the deltoid region or anterolateral thigh.
*   **Pharmacokinetics (Immune Response & Duration):**
    *   Induces a robust neutralizing antibody response after a complete series, typically higher than that following natural infection.
    *   Protection is long-lasting; follow-up data shows at least 10 years of protection. No booster doses are currently recommended after completing the primary series.
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications:**
    *   **Contraindication:** History of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the HPV vaccine (including yeast for Gardasil 9) or to a previous dose.
    *   **Precaution:** Moderate or severe acute illness (defer vaccination until illness improves).
    *   **Precaution (Syncope):** Syncope (fainting) can occur, sometimes resulting in injury. Observe patients for 15 minutes after administration. Have procedures in place to manage syncope.
    *   **Pregnancy:** HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy. However, no adverse outcomes have been associated with inadvertent administration during pregnancy. If a person becomes pregnant during the vaccine series, delay remaining doses until after pregnancy. Pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination. Merck maintains a pregnancy registry for Gardasil 9.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common (≥10%):**
        *   Injection site reactions: Pain (most common, ~84%), redness, swelling (~25% each).
        *   Systemic: Headache (~28%), fever (~13%), nausea, dizziness.
    *   **Less Common/Rare:** Syncope (can lead to falls and injuries), anaphylaxis (very rare).
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   Immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, chemotherapy, radiation) may reduce the immune response to HPV vaccine. The benefits of vaccination may still outweigh risks.
    *   Can be co-administered with other age-appropriate vaccines (e.g., Tdap, meningococcal conjugate) during the same visit, using separate injection sites.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **Indications:** Prevention of infections and diseases caused by the HPV types covered by the vaccine, including:
        *   Cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers.
        *   Anogenital warts (condyloma acuminata).
        *   Precancerous or dysplastic lesions (e.g., CIN, VIN, VaIN, AIS).
    *   **Target Population & Routine Vaccination:** Recommended for routine vaccination at age 11–12 years (can be started at age 9).
    *   **Catch-Up Vaccination:** Recommended for all persons through age 26 years who were not adequately vaccinated previously.
    *   **Shared Clinical Decision-Making (Adults 27–45 years):** For adults aged 27–45 years not adequately vaccinated, HPV vaccination can be considered based on shared clinical decision-making. Discuss potential benefits based on individual risk (e.g., new sexual partners). Most adults in this age range have likely been exposed to HPV, so vaccination offers less benefit.
    *   **Dosing Schedules (Gardasil 9):
        *   **Ages 9–14 years at series initiation:**
            *   **2-dose series:** Administer at 0 and 6–12 months. The minimum interval is 5 months between doses. If the second dose is administered earlier than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should be given at least 4 months after the second dose and at least 6 months after the first dose.
        *   **Ages 15–45 years at series initiation (including those aged 9-26 years who received first dose at age ≥15, or those aged 27-45 years based on shared clinical decision-making):**
            *   **3-dose series:** Administer at 0, 1–2 months, and 6 months.
            *   Minimum intervals: 4 weeks between dose 1 and 2; 12 weeks between dose 2 and 3; 5 months between dose 1 and 3. If a dose is given too soon, it should be repeated after the appropriate interval.
        *   **Immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection, regardless of immune status, aged 9 through 26 years):**
            *   **3-dose series:** Recommended at 0, 1–2, and 6 months, regardless of age at series initiation.
    *   **Syncope Prevention:** Administer vaccine while patient is seated or lying down. Observe for 15 minutes post-vaccination. Advise patient to change positions slowly. Be prepared to manage syncopal episodes.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide and review the current CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS).
    *   Discuss benefits of HPV vaccination (cancer and wart prevention) and risks.
    *   Screen for contraindications/precautions (e.g., severe allergy to yeast or previous dose, current moderate/severe illness, pregnancy status – though routine pregnancy testing not needed).
    *   Inform about common side effects: injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling are very common), and systemic symptoms like headache or mild fever. These are usually mild and transient.
    *   Advise on comfort measures: acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain/fever (if appropriate), cool compress for site soreness.
    *   Explain the importance of completing the recommended series for full protection.
    *   Emphasize that HPV vaccine does not protect against all HPV types or existing infections, so cervical cancer screening (e.g., Pap tests) should continue as recommended for females.
    *   Discuss signs of a severe allergic reaction (rare) and when to seek immediate medical attention (e.g., hives, facial swelling, difficulty breathing, dizziness).
    *   Address the risk of syncope; explain the 15-minute observation period.
    *   Ensure proper documentation: provide VIS and document its provision, record vaccine name, lot number, administration site, and date. Report any clinically significant adverse events to VAERS.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   No routine pre-vaccination or post-vaccination serologic testing for HPV immunity is recommended.
    *   Observe patient for 15 minutes after vaccination to monitor for syncope and acute reactions.

##### 9. Influenza Vaccine (Inactivated/Recombinant)

*   **Disease Prevented:** Seasonal influenza, a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses, which can lead to complications such as pneumonia, hospitalization, and death, especially in high-risk individuals.
*   **Pharmacodynamics:**
    *   **Vaccine Types (Focus on Inactivated/Recombinant for this section):**
        *   **Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV4):** Quadrivalent, containing antigens from two influenza A strains (H1N1, H3N2) and two influenza B lineage viruses. Examples include standard-dose (e.g., Afluria®, Fluarix®, Flucelvax®, FluLaval®, Fluzone®), high-dose (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent® for adults ≥65 years), and adjuvanted (Fluad Quadrivalent® for adults ≥65 years).
        *   **Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4):** Quadrivalent, produced using recombinant DNA technology (egg-free). Example: Flublok Quadrivalent® (for adults ≥18 years).
        *   *(Note: Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4), FluMist®, is also available but is a live vaccine administered intranasally for healthy, non-pregnant individuals aged 2–49 years and is not detailed in this inactivated vaccine section).*
    *   **Mechanism:** IIV4 contains inactivated (killed) virus particles or viral proteins. RIV4 contains recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins. Both stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies against the specific influenza virus strains included in the vaccine. Vaccine composition is updated annually based on global surveillance of circulating strains.
    *   **Efficacy:** Varies annually depending on the match between vaccine strains and circulating viruses, and host factors. Generally 40–60% effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. Can also reduce severity of illness in vaccinated persons who still get sick.
*   **Administration:**
    *   **IIV4/RIV4:** Intramuscular (IM) injection. Deltoid muscle for adults and older children; anterolateral thigh for infants and young children.
*   **Pharmacokinetics (Immune Response & Duration):**
    *   **Onset:** Protective antibody levels are typically achieved within 2 weeks after vaccination.
    *   **Duration:** Immunity is generally considered to last for the influenza season (approximately 6-12 months). Antibody levels may decline over time.
    *   **Annual Revaccination:** Recommended due to waning immunity and ongoing antigenic changes (drift) in circulating influenza viruses.
*   **Key Precautions/Contraindications (for IIV4/RIV4):**
    *   **Contraindication:** History of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine or to any vaccine component (excluding eggs for egg-free vaccines like RIV4 or cell-culture based IIV4 if applicable).
    *   **Contraindication (Conditional):** History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination is a precaution for most individuals.
    *   **Precaution:** Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (defer vaccination until illness improves).
    *   **Egg Allergy:**
        *   Persons with a history of egg allergy of any severity (including anaphylaxis) can receive any licensed, recommended, age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4 if otherwise appropriate). Additional safety measures (e.g., 30-minute observation) are no longer routinely recommended beyond standard post-vaccination observation, unless the reaction was severe (requiring epinephrine or emergency medical intervention), in which case vaccination in a medical setting supervised by a healthcare provider able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions is advised for IIV4 or RIV4.
        *   Flublok® (RIV4) and Flucelvax® (ccIIV4) are egg-free.
    *   **Pregnancy:** IIV4 and RIV4 are recommended for pregnant women during any trimester to protect both the mother and infant.
    *   **Immunocompromised Persons:** IIV4 or RIV4 are recommended. (LAIV4 is contraindicated).
    *   **Age:** Not approved for infants <6 months of age.
*   **Adverse Reactions (IIV4/RIV4):**
    *   **Common (≥10%):**
        *   Injection site reactions: Pain (most common), redness, swelling.
        *   Systemic: Low-grade fever, malaise, myalgia, headache (usually begin within 6–12 hours and last 1–2 days).
    *   **Less Common/Rare:**
        *   Immediate allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (very rare, ~1-3 cases per million doses).
        *   Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): Acknowledged as a rare adverse event following influenza vaccination, with an estimated risk of ~1 additional case per million persons vaccinated. A history of GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccine is a precaution.
*   **Drug Interactions (IIV4/RIV4):**
    *   Immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, chemotherapy) may reduce the immune response to the vaccine.
    *   Can be co-administered with other vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, at different injection sites.
    *   No clinically significant interactions expected with most medications. (Note: Antiviral medications like oseltamivir may interfere with the efficacy of LAIV4 if given within specific timeframes, but LAIV4 is not the focus here).
    *   Theoretical interactions with theophylline, phenytoin, warfarin have been posited but are not well established; monitor if clinically indicated.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing (IIV4/RIV4):**
    *   **Annual Recommendation:** Recommended annually for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications.
    *   **Timing:** Vaccination should ideally occur before the onset of influenza activity in the community (e.g., by the end of October in the Northern Hemisphere). Continue to offer throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating.
    *   **Dosing (Standard-dose IIV4 or RIV4):**
        *   **Adults and Children ≥9 years:** One 0.5 mL dose IM annually.
        *   **Children 6 months through 8 years:**
            *   **If previously vaccinated with ≥2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (separated by ≥4 weeks) before July 1st of the current year:** One 0.5 mL dose IM annually.
            *   **If receiving influenza vaccine for the first time, or have not previously received ≥2 doses, or vaccination history is unknown:** Two 0.5 mL doses IM, administered at least 4 weeks apart. The first dose primes the immune system; the second dose provides protection.
            *   *(Note: Some IIV4 products are licensed for a 0.25 mL dose for children 6–35 months, but 0.5 mL is also an option for this age group for most products. Check product-specific labeling.)*
    *   **Special Formulations for Adults ≥65 years:**
        *   **High-Dose Quadrivalent IIV4 (HD-IIV4, e.g., Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent®):** Contains four times the antigen of standard-dose IIV4s. Preferred option for this age group.
        *   **Adjuvanted Quadrivalent IIV4 (aIIV4, e.g., Fluad Quadrivalent®):** Contains MF59 adjuvant. Preferred option for this age group.
        *   If neither HD-IIV4 nor aIIV4 is available, any other age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 should be used.
    *   **Egg-Free Options:**
        *   **Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4, Flublok Quadrivalent®):** Approved for adults ≥18 years.
        *   **Cell-Culture Based Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (ccIIV4, Flucelvax Quadrivalent®):** Approved for persons ≥6 months.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide and review the current CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS).
    *   Screen for contraindications and precautions (e.g., severe allergy to previous flu vaccine or components, history of GBS after flu vaccine, current moderate/severe illness).
    *   Discuss benefits of annual influenza vaccination for personal and community protection, especially for high-risk individuals.
    *   Inform about common side effects: soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site; low-grade fever, muscle aches, headache. These are generally mild and last 1–2 days.
    *   Explain that the inactivated vaccine cannot cause influenza illness because it contains killed viruses or only a single protein from the influenza virus.
    *   Advise on comfort measures for side effects: acetaminophen or NSAIDs (if appropriate) for pain or fever; warm compress to injection site for soreness.
    *   Discuss when to seek medical care: signs of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat, dizziness, weakness) usually within minutes to hours after vaccination; high fever; persistent or severe injection site pain; or symptoms of GBS (e.g., weakness or tingling sensations, difficulty walking).
    *   Emphasize that full protection develops about 2 weeks after vaccination.
    *   Ensure proper documentation: provide VIS and document its provision, record vaccine type (e.g., IIV4, RIV4, specific product name), lot number, administration site, and date. Report any clinically significant adverse events to VAERS.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   No routine pre-vaccination or post-vaccination serologic testing for influenza immunity is recommended.
    *   Observe patient for 15 minutes after vaccination to monitor for syncope and acute reactions (30 minutes if there's a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous vaccine or injectable therapy, though not specifically for egg allergy if an appropriate vaccine is used).

##### h5 G. Pneumococcal Vaccine

Prevents invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, including pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia.

*   **Pharmacodynamics:**
    *   **Vaccine Types:**
        *   **Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCVs):**
            *   PCV13 (Prevnar 13®): Contains 13 serotypes.
            *   PCV15 (Vaxneuvance®): Contains 15 serotypes (PCV13 + 22F, 33F).
            *   PCV20 (Prevnar 20®): Contains 20 serotypes (PCV13 + 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, 33F).
        *   **Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPSV23):**
            *   Pneumovax 23®: Contains 23 serotypes.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:**
        *   **PCVs:** Capsular polysaccharides are covalently linked (conjugated) to a carrier protein (nontoxic diphtheria CRM197 protein). This conjugation converts the T-cell-independent immune response (typical of polysaccharides) to a T-cell-dependent response, leading to improved immunogenicity in infants and young children, and the generation of immunologic memory.
        *   **PPSV23:** Induces a T-cell-independent immune response. Generally less immunogenic in children <2 years.
    *   **Serotype Coverage:** Vaccines are designed to cover the most common invasive disease-causing serotypes. Newer conjugate vaccines (PCV15, PCV20) offer broader coverage than PCV13.
*   **Administration & Pharmacokinetics:**
    *   **Administration Route:**
        *   PCVs (PCV13, PCV15, PCV20): Intramuscular (IM) injection only.
        *   PPSV23: Intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) injection.
    *   **Onset of Protection:** Antibodies are generally detectable within 2-3 weeks after vaccination, with peak response by 4-6 weeks.
    *   **Duration of Protection:**
        *   PCVs: Expected to provide long-term protection after completion of the recommended series, due to induction of immune memory.
        *   PPSV23: Antibody levels typically decline over 5-10 years; revaccination may be needed for certain populations. Decline may be faster in immunocompromised individuals.
*   **Precautions and Contraindications:**
    *   **Absolute Contraindications:**
        *   Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any pneumococcal vaccine or to any component of the vaccine.
        *   For PCVs (PCV13, PCV15, PCV20), a history of anaphylaxis to any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine (due to the CRM197 carrier protein).
    *   **Precautions:**
        *   Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever: Vaccination should generally be deferred until the condition improves.
        *   History of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous pneumococcal vaccine (use clinical judgment).
        *   Bleeding disorders or anticoagulant therapy: Administer IM with caution (use a fine-gauge needle, apply firm pressure for ≥2 minutes). PPSV23 can be given SC if risk of IM injection is high.
    *   **Special Populations:**
        *   **Pregnancy:** Data on PCV use during pregnancy are limited. PPSV23 may be administered during pregnancy if indicated (e.g., high-risk conditions) and benefits outweigh potential risks. Clinicians should weigh risks/benefits based on individual patient factors and risk of pneumococcal disease.
        *   **Immunocompromised Persons (e.g., HIV, malignancy, immunosuppressive therapy):** May have a diminished immune response to pneumococcal vaccines. Specific recommendations for timing and choice of vaccine apply (see Clinical Use/Dosing).
        *   **Anatomic or Functional Asplenia (including sickle cell disease):** At very high risk for IPD; pneumococcal vaccination is critical.
        *   **Cochlear Implants or Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Leaks:** Also at increased risk for pneumococcal meningitis.
*   **Vaccine Interchangeability Notes:**
    *   For children, PCV13 and PCV15 are considered interchangeable for the multi-dose series. It is preferred to complete the series with the same vaccine product if possible.
    *   If a child has started with PCV13 and PCV15 becomes available, PCV15 can be used to complete the series.
    *   There is currently no data on the interchangeability of PCV20 with other PCVs for a multi-dose series in children.
    *   For adults receiving a single dose of PCV, interchangeability is less of an issue, but the choice between PCV15+PPSV23 vs. PCV20 should be guided by ACIP recommendations.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common (≥10%):**
        *   **Local (Injection Site):** Pain/tenderness (most common, 30-50% with PCVs, can be higher with PPSV23), redness, swelling.
        *   **Systemic:**
            *   *Infants/Young Children (PCVs):* Fever (15-25%), irritability (up to 80%), drowsiness, decreased appetite, restlessness.
            *   *Older Children/Adults (PCVs & PPSV23):* Myalgia, fatigue, headache (30-40% with PCVs), fever (<5% in adults with PCVs, may be higher with PPSV23, especially if revaccinated sooner than recommended).
    *   **Less Common/Serious (Rare):**
        *   Anaphylaxis (<1 per million doses).
        *   Febrile seizures in children (PCVs): Estimated at 1-3 per 10,000 doses, particularly when co-administered with inactivated influenza vaccine.
        *   Large local reactions with PPSV23, especially with revaccination.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   **Immunosuppressive Therapies:** Corticosteroids, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other immunosuppressants may reduce the immune response to pneumococcal vaccines. When possible, vaccinate before initiating or after discontinuing immunosuppressive therapy, or during periods of lower immunosuppression.
    *   **Other Vaccines:** Pneumococcal vaccines can be administered concurrently with most other routine vaccines (e.g., influenza, DTaP, Hib, hepatitis B) at different anatomical sites. Co-administration of PCV13 and trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) has been associated with a slightly increased risk of febrile seizures in young children.
    *   **Antibody-Containing Products:** No evidence suggests that blood products or immunoglobulins interfere with the response to pneumococcal vaccines.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing (Current ACIP Recommendations Summary):**
    *   **(Note: Recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination are complex and depend on age, underlying medical conditions, and prior pneumococcal vaccination history. Always consult the latest ACIP guidelines.)**
    *   **Children (Routine Immunization):**
        *   **PCV13 or PCV15:** A 4-dose series is recommended at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age.
        *   **Catch-up schedules** exist for children who are unvaccinated or fall behind.
    *   **Children (2-18 years) with High-Risk Conditions:** (e.g., immunocompromising conditions, CSF leak, cochlear implant, sickle cell disease, asplenia, chronic heart/lung/liver/kidney disease, diabetes)
        *   May require PCV13/PCV15 and/or PPSV23 depending on age and specific condition, and prior vaccination history. Often involves a PCV dose followed by PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later, and potentially a second PPSV23 dose 5 years after the first.
    *   **Adults 19-64 years with Certain Chronic Medical Conditions or Other Risk Factors:** (e.g., chronic heart, lung, or liver disease, diabetes, alcoholism, smoking)
        *   **Option 1:** 1 dose of PCV20.
        *   **Option 2:** 1 dose of PCV15 followed by 1 dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later.
        *   (If PPSV23 was previously received, a dose of PCV20 or PCV15 can be given at least 1 year after the last PPSV23 dose.)
    *   **Adults 19-64 years who are Immunocompromised, or have CSF leaks or cochlear implants:**
        *   **Option 1:** 1 dose of PCV20.
        *   **Option 2:** 1 dose of PCV15 followed by 1 dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later.
        *   (Detailed schedules apply if previously vaccinated with PCV13 and/or PPSV23).
    *   **Adults ≥65 years (Routine Recommendation for All):**
        *   **Option 1 (Preferred):** 1 dose of PCV20.
        *   **Option 2:** 1 dose of PCV15 followed by 1 dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later.
        *   **If previously vaccinated with PPSV23 only (at any age):** Give 1 dose of PCV20 or PCV15 at least 1 year after the last PPSV23 dose.
        *   **If previously vaccinated with PCV13 (with or without PPSV23):** Consult ACIP guidelines for specific recommendations on completing the series with PCV20 or PCV15/PPSV23.
    *   **Special Considerations:**
        *   **Cochlear Implants or CSF Leaks:** Specific PCV and PPSV23 schedules apply due to high risk of meningitis.
        *   **Elective Splenectomy or Immunosuppressive Therapy Initiation:** Complete all indicated pneumococcal vaccinations at least 2 weeks before the procedure or therapy initiation if possible.
        *   **Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Recipients:** Require revaccination with a PCV series (typically PCV13 or PCV15) followed by PPSV23, usually starting 3-6 months post-transplant, regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination history.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide and review the appropriate CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for PCV13/PCV15/PCV20 and/or PPSV23.
    *   Screen for contraindications and precautions, especially severe allergy to a previous dose or any vaccine component (including diphtheria toxoid for PCVs).
    *   Discuss the benefits of vaccination in preventing serious pneumococcal diseases like pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia.
    *   Inform about common side effects:
        *   Injection site: Soreness, redness, swelling (common).
        *   Systemic: Fever, fussiness/irritability (especially in young children), drowsiness, decreased appetite, muscle aches, fatigue (more common in adults).
        *   These are generally mild and resolve within 1-2 days.
    *   Advise on comfort measures: acetaminophen or NSAIDs (if appropriate) for pain or fever; cool compress to injection site.
    *   Explain when to seek medical care: signs of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat), high fever (e.g., >102°F/38.9°C), persistent severe injection site pain, or unusual behavioral changes in children.
    *   Ensure proper documentation: provide VIS, record vaccine type (e.g., PCV15, PCV20, PPSV23), lot number, administration site, and date. Report any clinically significant adverse events to VAERS.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   No routine pre-vaccination or post-vaccination serologic testing for pneumococcal immunity is recommended.
    *   Observe patient for 15 minutes after vaccination to monitor for syncope and acute reactions (30 minutes if there's a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous vaccine or injectable therapy).

> [!TIP]
> **Clinical Pearls for Pneumococcal Vaccination:**
> - PPSV23 should **never** be administered to children younger than 2 years of age due to poor immunogenicity.
> - The minimum interval between a PCV dose (PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20) and a subsequent PPSV23 dose is 8 weeks for individuals with immunocompromising conditions, CSF leaks, or cochlear implants. For other groups requiring both PCV and PPSV23, the minimum interval is typically 1 year.
> - If a pneumococcal vaccine series (e.g., the childhood PCV series) is interrupted, there is no need to restart the series; resume dosing as soon as feasible, respecting minimum intervals between doses.
> - The availability of PCV20 has simplified adult pneumococcal vaccination schedules, often allowing for a single-dose approach for many adults who have not previously received a PCV or whose pneumococcal vaccination history is unknown.

##### h5 H. Meningococcal Vaccine

Prevents invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by *Neisseria meningitidis*, including meningitis and meningococcemia (septicemia). IMD can progress rapidly and has high morbidity and mortality rates even with appropriate antibiotic treatment.

*   **Pharmacodynamics:**
    *   **Vaccine Types:** Two main types of meningococcal vaccines are available, targeting different serogroups:
        *   **Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccines (MenACWY):** Protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y.
            *   MenACWY-D (Menactra®): Conjugated to diphtheria toxoid.
            *   MenACWY-CRM (Menveo®): Conjugated to CRM197 (a non-toxic variant of diphtheria toxin).
            *   MenACWY-TT (MenQuadfi®): Conjugated to tetanus toxoid.
        *   **Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccines (MenB):** Protect against serogroup B.
            *   MenB-FHbp (Trumenba®): Contains two recombinant lipidated factor H binding protein (FHbp) variants.
            *   MenB-4C (Bexsero®): Contains four recombinant protein components (NadA, NHBA, fHbp, PorA P1.4).
    *   **Mechanism of Action:**
        *   **MenACWY vaccines:** Capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, W, and Y are conjugated to a carrier protein. This enhances immunogenicity, particularly in infants, and induces T-cell dependent immune responses, leading to bactericidal antibody production and immunologic memory.
        *   **MenB vaccines:** Utilize recombinant protein antigens found on the surface of *N. meningitidis* serogroup B to stimulate production of bactericidal antibodies.
    *   **Efficacy:**
        *   MenACWY vaccines are highly effective (80-85%) against the serogroups they cover.
        *   MenB vaccine efficacy is estimated between 62-88% against circulating MenB strains, varying by specific vaccine and strain characteristics.
*   **Administration & Pharmacokinetics:**
    *   **Administration Route:** All currently available meningococcal vaccines are administered via Intramuscular (IM) injection.
        *   Preferred injection site: Deltoid muscle in older children, adolescents, and adults; anterolateral thigh in infants and younger children.
    *   **Onset of Protection:** Protective antibody levels are generally achieved within 7-10 days after completion of the primary series, with peak response by 2-4 weeks.
    *   **Duration of Protection:**
        *   Antibody levels decline over time, typically within 3-5 years after MenACWY vaccination. Protection may wane more rapidly in infants and young children.
        *   Duration of protection for MenB vaccines is still being evaluated, but booster doses may be needed for sustained protection in individuals at ongoing high risk.
        *   Booster doses are recommended for certain populations to maintain protection.
*   **Precautions and Contraindications:**
    *   **Absolute Contraindications:**
        *   Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the specific meningococcal vaccine or to any of its components.
        *   For MenACWY-D (Menactra®): History of severe allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid.
        *   For MenACWY-TT (MenQuadfi®): History of severe allergic reaction to tetanus toxoid.
        *   A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a contraindication for some meningococcal vaccines (consult specific product information and ACIP guidelines, as this can be a precaution for others).
    *   **Precautions:**
        *   Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever: Defer vaccination until the condition improves.
        *   History of GBS within 6 weeks of a previous meningococcal vaccine (unless benefit clearly outweighs risk).
    *   **Special Populations:**
        *   **Pregnancy:** Safety data for meningococcal vaccines during pregnancy are limited. MenACWY vaccines may be administered if the woman is at increased risk for meningococcal disease and benefits outweigh potential risks. MenB vaccine use during pregnancy should generally be deferred unless the woman is at increased risk and benefits are considered to outweigh potential risks after consultation with her healthcare provider.
        *   **Immunocompromised Persons:** May have a reduced immune response. Specific dosing schedules may apply.
        *   **Anatomic or Functional Asplenia, Persistent Complement Component Deficiencies (e.g., C3, C5-C9, properdin, factor D, factor H), or individuals receiving complement inhibitors (e.g., eculizumab, ravulizumab):** These individuals are at extremely high risk for invasive meningococcal disease and vaccination is critical.
*   **Vaccine Interchangeability Notes:**
    *   **MenACWY Vaccines:** If possible, the same MenACWY product should be used for all doses in a series. However, if the product used for previous doses is unknown or unavailable, any MenACWY product can be used to complete the series.
    *   **MenB Vaccines:** MenB vaccines (Bexsero® and Trumenba®) are **NOT** interchangeable. The same product must be used for all doses in a MenB series. They have different antigens and dosing schedules.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common (≥10%):**
        *   **Local (Injection Site):** Pain (most common, 50-60%), redness, swelling, induration.
        *   **Systemic:** Fatigue (30-40%), headache (30-35%), myalgia (25-30%), arthralgia (15-20%), fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea. (Incidence can be higher with MenB vaccines, especially when co-administered with other vaccines or for subsequent doses in a series).
    *   **Less Common/Serious (Rare):**
        *   Anaphylaxis (<1 per million doses).
        *   Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): A very rare association has been reported; a history of GBS is a contraindication or precaution for some products.
        *   Syncope (fainting) can occur, especially in adolescents and young adults; post-vaccination observation is important.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   **Immunosuppressive Therapies:** Corticosteroids, chemotherapy, radiation, and other immunosuppressants may reduce the immune response. Vaccinate before or after therapy if possible, or during periods of lower immunosuppression.
    *   **Other Vaccines:** Meningococcal vaccines can generally be co-administered with other age-appropriate vaccines (e.g., Tdap, HPV, influenza) during the same visit, but at different anatomical sites. If MenB vaccines are given with other vaccines, particularly those known to cause fever (like DTaP-containing vaccines), there may be an increased risk of febrile reactions.
    *   **Antibody-Containing Products:** No known interference when given simultaneously with blood products or immunoglobulins.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing (Current ACIP Recommendations Summary):**
    *   **(Note: Recommendations are complex and vary by age, risk factors, specific vaccine product, and prior vaccination history. Always consult the latest ACIP guidelines.)**
    *   **Routine Adolescent Vaccination:**
        *   **MenACWY:**
            *   Primary dose: Routinely recommended at age 11-12 years.
            *   Booster dose: Routinely recommended at age 16 years. (If the first dose is given at age 16 years or older, a booster is not routinely needed unless the individual remains at increased risk).
        *   **MenB:**
            *   Recommended for adolescents and young adults aged 16-23 years (preferred age 16-18 years) based on shared clinical decision-making to provide short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease.
            *   Not routinely recommended for all adolescents due to lower incidence of MenB disease compared to MenACWY, vaccine efficacy, and duration of protection considerations.
    *   **High-Risk Groups (Infants ≥2 months, Children, Adolescents, and Adults):**
        *   **MenACWY is recommended for individuals with:**
            *   Anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease).
            *   Persistent complement component deficiencies (C3, C5-C9, properdin, factor D, factor H).
            *   Use of complement inhibitors (e.g., eculizumab, ravulizumab).
            *   HIV infection.
            *   Microbiologists routinely exposed to *N. meningitidis* isolates.
            *   Persons identified as at increased risk because of a meningococcal disease outbreak attributable to serogroup A, C, W, or Y.
            *   Travelers to or residents of countries where meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic (e.g., the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa).
            *   Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated first-year college students living in residential housing (if not vaccinated at age ≥16 years).
            *   Military recruits.
        *   **MenB is recommended for individuals with:**
            *   Anatomic or functional asplenia, complement deficiencies, or use of complement inhibitors (as listed above for MenACWY).
            *   Microbiologists routinely exposed.
            *   Persons identified as at increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak.
    *   **Dosing Schedules (Examples - consult specific product information and ACIP for full details):**
        *   **MenACWY:**
            *   *Infants/Young Children at High Risk (e.g., asplenia, complement deficiency):* Multi-dose series starting as early as 2 or 6 months, depending on the product (Menactra, Menveo, MenQuadfi) and age. Booster doses are required.
            *   *Older Children/Adolescents/Adults at High Risk:* 1 or 2 primary doses depending on age and product, followed by booster doses every 3-5 years as long as risk remains.
            *   *Routine Adolescent (11-12 years):* 1 dose, then booster at 16 years.
        *   **MenB (for ages 10-25 years when indicated or as shared clinical decision-making for 16-23 years):**
            *   *Bexsero (MenB-4C):* 2 doses, administered at least 1 month apart.
            *   *Trumenba (MenB-FHbp):* 2 doses, administered at 0 and 6 months. If dose 2 is given earlier than 6 months, a 3rd dose is needed at least 4 months after dose 2. (A 3-dose schedule at 0, 1-2, and 6 months is also an option, particularly for outbreak settings).
    *   **Special Considerations for High-Risk Groups:**
        *   Individuals with ongoing high-risk conditions (e.g., asplenia, complement deficiencies, HIV, travel to endemic areas, microbiologists) require booster doses of MenACWY (typically every 5 years, or every 3 years for some younger children if risk persists).
        *   For those with asplenia or complement deficiencies, both MenACWY and MenB vaccines are recommended due to high susceptibility to all serogroups.
        *   During an outbreak, follow local public health recommendations for vaccination, which may include specific MenACWY or MenB products and schedules.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide and review the appropriate CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for MenACWY and/or MenB vaccines.
    *   Screen for contraindications and precautions, including severe allergies to vaccine components (e.g., diphtheria or tetanus toxoid for certain MenACWY products) or a history of GBS after a previous meningococcal vaccine.
    *   Discuss the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe and potentially fatal meningococcal disease.
    *   Explain the difference between MenACWY and MenB vaccines and why both may be recommended depending on age and risk factors.
    *   Inform about common side effects: injection site pain, redness, swelling; systemic symptoms like fatigue, headache, muscle aches, fever. These are usually mild and last 1-2 days. MenB vaccines may have a higher likelihood of causing these reactions.
    *   Advise on comfort measures: acetaminophen or NSAIDs (if appropriate) for pain or fever; cool compress for local reactions.
    *   Explain when to seek medical care: signs of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat), high fever, persistent severe injection site pain, or symptoms suggestive of GBS (e.g., weakness, tingling, difficulty walking).
    *   Emphasize the importance of completing the recommended series for full protection, especially for MenB vaccines.
    *   For adolescents receiving MenB vaccine based on shared clinical decision-making, ensure the patient and parents understand the rationale, benefits, and risks.
    *   Ensure proper documentation: provide VIS, record vaccine type (specific product name for MenACWY and MenB), lot number, administration site, and date. Report any clinically significant adverse events to VAERS.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   No routine pre-vaccination or post-vaccination serologic testing for meningococcal immunity is recommended.
    *   Observe patient for 15 minutes after vaccination to monitor for syncope and acute reactions (30 minutes if there's a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous vaccine or injectable therapy).

> [!TIP]
> **Clinical Pearls for Meningococcal Vaccination:**
> - If both MenACWY and MenB vaccines are indicated, they can be administered during the same visit, but at different injection sites.
> - Do not delay MenB vaccination for individuals at increased risk for serogroup B disease (e.g., those with complement deficiencies, asplenia, or during an outbreak).
> - For healthy adolescents undergoing shared clinical decision-making for MenB vaccination, document the discussion and the decision made.
> - Be aware of state or institutional requirements for meningococcal vaccination (often MenACWY) for college entry or campus housing.

##### i. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine

Indicated for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in older adults.

*   **Pharmacodynamics:**
    *   **Vaccine Type:** Recombinant, adjuvanted RSV F glycoprotein vaccine.
        *   Example: Arexvy® (RSVPreF3 + AS01E adjuvant).
        *   Another product: Abrysvo® (RSVPreF) - also approved for maternal use to protect infants.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** Contains a stabilized prefusion form of the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein. The F protein is crucial for viral entry into host cells. The vaccine elicits neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses against this prefusion F protein, preventing viral infection and LRTD.
    *   **Efficacy (example for Arexvy® in older adults):**
        *   Overall efficacy against RSV-associated LRTD: ~82.6%.
        *   Efficacy against severe RSV-LRTD: ~94.1%.
        *   (Efficacy for Abrysvo® in older adults is also high; specific figures vary slightly).
*   **Pharmacokinetics & Administration:**
    *   **Administration Route:** Intramuscular (IM) injection, typically in the deltoid muscle.
    *   **Dose:** Single 0.5 mL dose.
    *   **Onset of Protection:** Protective immunity develops within a few weeks.
    *   **Duration of Protection:** Protection has been demonstrated through at least one RSV season. Data on the duration of protection beyond one season and the need for revaccination are still being evaluated. Current recommendations are for a single dose.
*   **Precautions and Contraindications:**
    *   **Contraindications:**
        *   History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine.
    *   **Precautions:**
        *   Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever: Defer vaccination until the condition improves.
        *   Bleeding disorders or anticoagulant therapy: Administer with caution to avoid bleeding/hematoma at the injection site.
        *   Syncope: Can occur post-vaccination; observe patients for 15 minutes.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common (≥10%):**
        *   **Local (Injection Site):** Pain (most common, ~60%), redness, swelling.
        *   **Systemic:** Fatigue (~34%), myalgia (~29%), headache (~27%), arthralgia (~18%), fever.
    *   **Serious (Rare):**
        *   Anaphylaxis.
        *   Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and other inflammatory neurologic events have been reported rarely in post-marketing surveillance for some RSV vaccines. A causal link has not been definitively established, but this is an area of ongoing monitoring.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   No specific drug interaction studies have been conducted. Can generally be co-administered with other adult vaccines (e.g., influenza, COVID-19) at different injection sites, though local or systemic reactions might be increased.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing (Current ACIP Recommendations Summary):**
    *   **Indication:** Adults aged 60 years and older, using shared clinical decision-making.
        *   Shared clinical decision-making involves considering the patient's risk for severe RSV disease (e.g., chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised state, advanced age, residents of nursing homes) and their preferences.
    *   **Dosing:** Single 0.5 mL IM dose.
    *   **Booster Doses:** Currently, no routine booster dose is recommended. Recommendations may be updated as more data become available.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide and review the CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) if available, or discuss key information.
    *   Explain that RSV is a common respiratory virus that can cause severe lung disease in older adults.
    *   Discuss the benefits of vaccination in reducing the risk of RSV-LRTD.
    *   Inform about common side effects: injection site pain, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, which are usually mild to moderate and resolve within a few days.
    *   Advise on comfort measures: acetaminophen or NSAIDs (if appropriate) for pain or fever; cool compress for local reactions.
    *   Explain when to seek medical care: signs of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat), high fever, persistent severe symptoms, or any concerning neurological symptoms (e.g., unusual weakness, tingling).
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Observe patient for 15 minutes after vaccination for syncope or acute allergic reactions.
    *   No routine serologic testing is recommended.

##### j. Typhoid Vaccine

Prevents typhoid fever, a systemic illness caused by *Salmonella enterica* serotype Typhi. Transmission typically occurs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces from an infected person.

*   **Pharmacodynamics:**
    *   **Vaccine Type:** Two main types have been widely used, though the focus here is on the inactivated injectable form common in the US:
        *   **Injectable Vi Capsular Polysaccharide Vaccine (Typhim Vi®):** Contains purified Vi capsular polysaccharide from *S. typhi*.
        *   (Oral live attenuated Ty21a vaccine (Vivotif®) also exists but is a live vaccine and has different considerations).
    *   **Mechanism of Action (Typhim Vi®):** Stimulates the production of anti-Vi IgG antibodies. These antibodies are believed to interfere with bacterial attachment to and invasion of host cells, thus preventing clinical disease.
    *   **Efficacy (Typhim Vi®):** Approximately 50-80% effective in preventing clinical typhoid fever. Efficacy can be influenced by the intensity of exposure (inoculum size) and local disease burden.
*   **Pharmacokinetics & Administration (Typhim Vi®):**
    *   **Administration Route:** Intramuscular (IM) injection.
    *   **Dose:** Single 0.5 mL dose.
    *   **Onset of Protection:** Protective antibody levels are generally achieved within 7-14 days post-vaccination.
    *   **Duration of Protection:** Immunity lasts for approximately 2-3 years. Booster doses are required for individuals with ongoing or repeated exposure (e.g., residents of or frequent travelers to endemic areas).
*   **Precautions and Contraindications (Typhim Vi®):**
    *   **Absolute Contraindications:**
        *   Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of typhoid vaccine or to any component of the vaccine.
    *   **Precautions:**
        *   Moderate or severe acute illness: Vaccination should generally be deferred until recovery.
        *   Bleeding disorders or anticoagulant therapy: Administer with caution to avoid bleeding/hematoma.
    *   **Special Populations:**
        *   **Pregnancy:** Typhim Vi (inactivated) is the preferred typhoid vaccine if vaccination is necessary during pregnancy. The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.
        *   **Children:** Typhim Vi is not recommended for children younger than 2 years of age due to a potentially suboptimal immune response to polysaccharide antigens in this age group.
        *   **Immunocompromised Persons:** May have a reduced immune response to the vaccine.
*   **Adverse Reactions (Typhim Vi®):**
    *   **Common (≥10%):**
        *   **Local (Injection Site):** Pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling (can be up to 70%). These reactions usually begin within 24 hours and last for 1-2 days.
        *   **Systemic:** Fever (5-10%), headache, malaise, myalgia.
    *   **Serious (Rare):**
        *   Anaphylaxis.
*   **Drug Interactions (Typhim Vi®):**
    *   **Immunosuppressive Therapies:** Patients receiving corticosteroids, chemotherapy, radiation, or other immunosuppressants may have a diminished immune response. If possible, vaccinate at least 2 weeks before starting or after discontinuing immunosuppressive therapy.
    *   **Other Vaccines:** Typhim Vi can generally be administered concurrently with other vaccines (e.g., hepatitis A, yellow fever), but at different injection sites. Data on co-administration with some vaccines may be limited.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing (Typhim Vi®):**
    *   **Indications:** Recommended for individuals aged 2 years and older who are at increased risk of exposure to *Salmonella enterica* serotype Typhi, including:
        1.  **Travelers:** Persons traveling to areas where typhoid fever is endemic or there is a recognized risk of exposure (especially South Asia, and parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America).
        2.  **Household Contacts:** Individuals with ongoing, close exposure to a documented chronic *S. typhi* carrier.
        3.  **Laboratory Workers:** Those who work frequently with *S. typhi* cultures.
    *   **Dosing Schedule:**
        *   **Primary Vaccination (Adults and Children ≥2 years):** A single 0.5 mL IM dose.
        *   Vaccination should ideally be completed at least 1-2 weeks before potential exposure to allow adequate time for an immune response to develop.
    *   **Booster Dose:** A booster dose of 0.5 mL IM is recommended every 2 years for individuals who remain at continued or renewed risk of exposure.

> [!NOTE]
> **Oral Live Attenuated Typhoid Vaccine (Vivotif®):**
> An alternative typhoid vaccine (not an inactivated vaccine) is Vivotif®. It consists of 4 oral capsules taken on alternate days (e.g., days 1, 3, 5, 7). It is for individuals ≥6 years old. The full course must be completed at least 1 week before potential exposure. A booster series is needed every 5 years for ongoing protection. Vivotif® is contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals and during pregnancy, and certain antibiotics should be avoided before and after its administration.

*   **Patient Education (Typhim Vi®):**
    *   Provide and review the CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS).
    *   Discuss specific travel itineraries and assess the risk of typhoid fever exposure.
    *   Screen for contraindications (severe allergy to previous dose/components) and precautions (acute illness).
    *   Advise that vaccination should be completed at least 1-2 weeks before travel to allow for an adequate immune response.
    *   Inform about common side effects: injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling) are common; systemic symptoms like fever, headache, or malaise can occur but are generally mild and transient.
    *   Recommend comfort measures: acetaminophen or NSAIDs (if appropriate) for pain or fever; cool compress for local reactions.
    *   Explain when to seek medical care: signs of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/throat), high or persistent fever, or severe, persistent symptoms.
    *   **Crucially, emphasize that vaccination is NOT 100% effective and does not replace the need for careful food and water precautions.** Counsel extensively on:
        *   Choosing safe foods: Eat foods that are thoroughly cooked and served hot. Avoid raw or undercooked meats and seafood. Avoid raw fruits and vegetables unless they can be peeled by the traveler themselves.
        *   Choosing safe beverages: Drink only bottled water (carbonated is often safer), boiled water, or commercially packaged beverages. Avoid tap water, ice cubes in drinks (unless made from safe water), and unpasteurized dairy products.
        *   Practicing good hand hygiene.
    *   Ensure proper documentation: provide VIS, record vaccine name (Typhim Vi®), lot number, administration site, and date in the patient's medical record and any applicable immunization registry.
*   **Monitoring (Typhim Vi®):**
    *   Observe patient for 15 minutes after vaccination for syncope or acute allergic reactions, especially if there is a history of allergies.
    *   No routine serologic testing for immunity is generally recommended.

> [!TIP]
> **Traveler's Health Pearl for Typhoid Vaccination:**
> - Advise travelers to consult a travel clinic or healthcare provider 4-6 weeks before departure. This allows for comprehensive pre-travel advice, including typhoid vaccination, other recommended vaccinations (e.g., Hepatitis A, Yellow Fever), and malaria prophylaxis if needed. This timing also ensures vaccines are administered with sufficient time to develop immunity before potential exposure.

##### k. Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) Vaccine

Prevents Japanese encephalitis (JE), a serious mosquito-borne viral illness prevalent in many parts of Asia and the Western Pacific. JE can lead to severe neurological complications, permanent disability, or death.

*   **Pharmacodynamics:**
    *   **Vaccine Type:** The primary vaccine available in many regions, including the U.S., is an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived vaccine (JE-VC).
        *   Example: IXIARO®.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** Induces the production of neutralizing antibodies against the Japanese Encephalitis virus, which are critical for protection.
    *   **Efficacy:** Highly immunogenic, with ≥96% of recipients achieving seroprotective antibody levels after a two-dose primary series. Protective efficacy is considered high.
*   **Pharmacokinetics & Administration:**
    *   **Administration Route:** Intramuscular (IM) injection, typically in the deltoid muscle.
    *   **Primary Series Dosing (IXIARO®):**
        *   **Adults (18 through 65 years):** Two 0.5 mL IM doses, administered 28 days apart (Day 0 and Day 28).
            *   *Accelerated Schedule (Adults 18-65 years):* If there is insufficient time for the standard schedule, two 0.5 mL IM doses can be administered 7 days apart (Day 0 and Day 7).
        *   **Children and Adolescents (3 years to <18 years):** Two 0.5 mL IM doses, administered 28 days apart.
        *   **Infants and Children (2 months to <3 years):** Two 0.25 mL IM doses, administered 28 days apart.
        *   **Adults >65 years:** Two 0.5 mL IM doses, administered 28 days apart. The accelerated schedule is not approved for this age group.
    *   **Booster Dose:**
        *   A single booster dose may be given at least 12 months (1 year) after completion of the primary series if ongoing exposure or re-exposure to JE virus is expected. The dose is 0.5 mL for individuals aged ≥3 years and 0.25 mL for children aged <3 years at the time of the booster.
        *   The need for further booster doses beyond the first one is not well established and depends on individual risk assessment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The primary immunization series should be completed at least 1 week prior to potential exposure to the JE virus to ensure adequate time for an immune response.

    *   **Onset of Protection:** Protective antibody levels are generally achieved after completion of the two-dose primary series (typically 7 days after the last dose).
    *   **Duration of Protection:** Immunity wanes over time. Booster doses are recommended for individuals at continued risk of exposure.
*   **Precautions and Contraindications:**
    *   **Absolute Contraindications:**
        *   History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of IXIARO® or any of its components, including protamine sulfate (used in manufacturing).
    *   **Precautions:**
        *   Moderate or severe acute illness: Vaccination should generally be deferred until recovery.
        *   Bleeding disorders or anticoagulant therapy: Administer with caution.
    *   **Special Populations:**
        *   **Pregnancy:** IXIARO® is generally contraindicated during pregnancy due to a lack of adequate safety data. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy for 4 weeks after vaccination. If travel to a high-risk JE area during pregnancy is unavoidable, a careful risk-benefit assessment with a healthcare provider is necessary.
        *   **Breastfeeding:** Data are limited; consult specific recommendations.
        *   **Children:** IXIARO® is approved for use in children aged 2 months and older. (Dosing varies by age).
        *   **Immunocompromised Persons:** May have a reduced immune response. Consultation with a specialist may be needed.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Common (≥10% in some studies, varies by age):**
        *   **Local (Injection Site):** Pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling (reported in 10-40% of recipients).
        *   **Systemic:** Headache, myalgia, fatigue. Low-grade fever can occur (e.g., 2-7% in children).
    *   **Serious (Rare):**
        *   Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) can occur.
            > [!WARNING]
            > **Hypersensitivity Reactions**: Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine.
        *   Neurological events (e.g., encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) have been reported very rarely post-vaccination, but a causal link to the vaccine is not definitively established.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   **Immunosuppressive Therapies:** Patients receiving corticosteroids, chemotherapy, radiation, or other immunosuppressants may have a diminished immune response to IXIARO®. If possible, vaccination should be completed at least 1 week before starting immunosuppressive therapy.
    *   **Other Vaccines:** IXIARO® can be administered concomitantly with other vaccines, such as hepatitis A vaccine. When co-administering, use different injection sites.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing:**
    *   **Indications:** IXIARO® is recommended for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis for individuals aged 2 months and older who are at increased risk of JE virus exposure. This includes:
        *   **Travelers:** Those planning to spend 1 month or longer in JE-endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season.
        *   **Short-term Travelers (<1 month):** Consider for those whose travel will include extensive outdoor activities, significant time in rural areas, or areas with ongoing outbreaks, especially during the transmission season.
        *   **Individuals with Planned Residence:** Persons moving to live in JE-endemic areas.
        *   **Laboratory Workers:** Those with potential exposure to JE virus in a laboratory setting.
        *   *Note:* Current information on JE virus transmission areas and seasons can be found in resources like the CDC Yellow Book or the CDC travel website.
    *   (Dosing schedules are detailed above under Pharmacokinetics & Administration).
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Provide and review the CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for Japanese Encephalitis vaccine.
    *   Thoroughly discuss the traveler's specific itinerary, duration of stay, planned activities (e.g., rural vs. urban, outdoor exposure), and time of year to assess the individual risk of JE exposure.
    *   Screen for contraindications (severe allergy to previous dose/components, including protamine sulfate) and precautions (acute illness, pregnancy considerations).
    *   Inform about common side effects: injection site reactions (pain, tenderness, redness, swelling) and mild systemic symptoms (headache, muscle aches, low-grade fever). Note that adverse reactions may occur up to 10 days after immunization.
    *   Advise on comfort measures: acetaminophen or NSAIDs (if appropriate) for pain or fever; cool compress for local reactions.
    *   Explain when to seek medical care: signs of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/throat), high fever, severe or persistent symptoms, or any concerning neurological symptoms.
    *   **Critically emphasize that vaccination is only one part of a comprehensive prevention strategy against Japanese Encephalitis.** Mosquito bite prevention measures are paramount. Counsel on meticulous mosquito bite avoidance:
        *   Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD), or 2-undecanone. Follow product instructions.
        *   Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks, and hats, especially during peak mosquito biting times (typically dusk to dawn for JE vectors).
        *   Treat clothing and gear (e.g., tents, boots) with permethrin. Do not apply permethrin directly to skin.
        *   Stay and sleep in screened or air-conditioned rooms whenever possible.
        *   Use a bed net if the sleeping area is exposed to the outdoors or not adequately screened, preferably one treated with permethrin.
    *   Advise patients not to travel outside the United States (or to remote areas without access to medical care) for at least 10 days after the last dose of IXIARO®, in case of delayed adverse reactions.
    *   Ensure proper documentation: provide the VIS, and record the vaccine name (IXIARO®), manufacturer, lot number, administration site, date administered, and vaccinator details in the patient's medical record and any applicable immunization registry.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Observe patient for 15-30 minutes after vaccination for immediate allergic reactions (e.g., syncope, anaphylaxis).
    *   No routine serologic testing for immunity is generally required post-vaccination.

> [!TIP]
> **Comprehensive Traveler's Health Consultation for JEV:**
> - Strongly recommend that individuals planning travel to JE-endemic areas have a pre-travel consultation with a healthcare provider specializing in travel medicine or a travel clinic, ideally 4-6 weeks before departure. This allows for a comprehensive risk assessment, discussion of JE vaccination, advice on all relevant health precautions (including other vaccinations like Hepatitis A, Typhoid, Yellow Fever if indicated), malaria prophylaxis if applicable, and detailed counseling on mosquito bite prevention strategies.

##### l. Plague Vaccine

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plague vaccine, which was a whole-cell vaccine made from inactivated *Yersinia pestis*, is **no longer available or manufactured for use in the United States**.

Vaccination against plague is not required by any country as a condition for entry. For individuals at potential risk of exposure to plague (e.g., those working with potentially infected animals in or traveling to areas with active enzootic or epizootic plague), the CDC recommends:

*   **Education:** Understand plague transmission (flea bites, direct contact with infected animals, inhalation of respiratory droplets from animals or humans with pneumonic plague) and its symptoms (sudden fever, chills, headache, weakness, swollen painful lymph nodes/buboes for bubonic plague).
*   **Flea Avoidance:** Use insect repellent (DEET) on skin and clothing, treat clothing with permethrin, avoid direct contact with wild rodents and their fleas, and ensure pets are treated for fleas if in plague-risk areas.
*   **Prophylactic Antibiotics:** For certain high-risk activities or exposures, short-term antimicrobial prophylaxis (e.g., doxycycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for children <8 years and pregnant women) may be considered. This should be based on CDC guidelines and consultation with public health authorities or infectious disease specialists.
*   **Early Medical Attention:** Seek immediate medical evaluation if plague is suspected (e.g., compatible symptoms after potential exposure). Early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are critical.

Refer to the current CDC Traveler's Health website (www.cdc.gov/travel) for the most up-to-date guidelines on plague prevention.

##### m. Rabies Vaccine

Prevents rabies, a nearly universally fatal viral encephalitis transmitted through the saliva of infected mammals, typically via bites, scratches, or, rarely, mucous membrane exposure.

*   **Pharmacodynamics:**
    *   **Vaccine Types (Inactivated Virus Vaccines):**
        *   **Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV):** Example: Imovax® Rabies.
        *   **Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCEC):** Example: RabAvert®.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** Both vaccine types contain inactivated rabies virus. They induce an active immune response, stimulating the production of neutralizing antibodies against the rabies virus glycoprotein. These antibodies are crucial for preventing the virus from entering the central nervous system and causing disease.
    *   **Efficacy:** Highly effective when administered appropriately according to recommended schedules for both pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Timely administration of PEP, including vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) if indicated, is virtually 100% effective in preventing rabies after exposure.
*   **Pharmacokinetics & Administration:**
    *   **Administration Route:** Intramuscular (IM) injection. The deltoid area is preferred for adults and older children; the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is preferred for infants and young children. **Never administer in the gluteal area** (potential for reduced efficacy).
    *   **Onset of Immunity:** Protective antibody levels (defined as ≥0.5 International Units (IU)/mL) are generally achieved within 7 to 14 days after initiating a primary pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis series.
    *   **Duration of Immunity:** After a complete primary PrEP series, immunity can persist for at least 2 years, but this can vary. Booster doses are recommended based on ongoing risk of exposure and, in some cases, rabies antibody titers.
*   **Precautions and Contraindications:**
    *   **Absolute Contraindications (for PrEP):**
        *   History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of rabies vaccine or any of its components (e.g., neomycin, gelatin, which may be present in trace amounts in some formulations like RabAvert®; Imovax® contains neomycin and phenol red).
    *   **Precautions (for PrEP):**
        *   Moderate or severe acute illness: Vaccination should generally be deferred until recovery.
        *   Immunocompromised individuals: May have a suboptimal immune response to the vaccine. If PrEP is considered, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is advisable, and post-vaccination serologic testing is crucial.
    *   **Special Populations:**
        *   **Pregnancy:** For PrEP, vaccination should be considered if the risk of rabies exposure is substantial and benefits outweigh potential risks. For Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), pregnancy is **NOT a contraindication** due to the fatal nature of rabies.
        *   **Children:** Rabies vaccines are safe and effective in children. Dosing is the same as for adults for both PrEP and PEP.

> [!WARNING]
> **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is a Medical Urgency**
> For any individual potentially exposed to rabies virus, PEP should be initiated as soon as possible. Delays in initiating PEP can be fatal. Pregnancy is NOT a contraindication to PEP. There are no contraindications to PEP when rabies exposure is suspected or confirmed.

*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   **Local Reactions (Common, 30-74%):** Pain, redness, swelling, itching, or induration at the injection site. These are generally mild and transient.
    *   **Systemic Reactions (Common, 5-40%):** Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches (myalgia), dizziness, and low-grade fever. These are also usually mild and self-limiting.
    *   **Immune Complex-like Reactions (Uncommon, reported in ~6% of persons receiving booster doses of HDCV - Imovax®):** Symptoms may include generalized urticaria (hives), arthralgia (joint pain), arthritis, angioedema, nausea, vomiting, fever, and malaise. These reactions typically occur 2-21 days after a booster dose and are thought to be due to an antigen-antibody complex formation. PCEC vaccine (RabAvert®) has a lower reported incidence of this type of reaction.
    *   **Serious (Rare):**
        *   Anaphylaxis (severe, life-threatening allergic reaction).
        *   Neurological events such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), encephalitis, and transverse myelitis have been reported very rarely following rabies vaccination. A definitive causal link is not always clear, and these events are extremely infrequent.
*   **Drug Interactions:**
    *   **Chloroquine and Related Antimalarials (e.g., Mefloquine):** Concurrent administration of chloroquine (and possibly other related antimalarials) may interfere with the antibody response to intradermal (ID) rabies vaccine. The ID route for PrEP is not typically used in the US. If PrEP is necessary for someone taking chloroquine, the IM route should be used. If possible, complete the PrEP series before starting chloroquine.
    *   **Immunosuppressive Agents:** Corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., chemotherapy, biologics), antimetabolites, alkylating agents, or radiation therapy can significantly reduce the immune response to rabies vaccine. For PrEP, vaccination should ideally be administered before or well after such treatments. For PEP in immunosuppressed individuals, it is critical to administer RIG (if indicated) and the full vaccine series; serological testing post-vaccination is essential to confirm an adequate immune response, and consultation with public health officials/experts is recommended.
    *   **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG):** Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG) provides passive immunity and can partially suppress the active immune response generated by the rabies vaccine. Therefore, it is crucial to **NOT exceed the recommended dose of RIG** and to administer RIG at an anatomical site different from the vaccine administration site. RIG should be infiltrated around and into the wound(s) as much as anatomically feasible, with any remaining volume given IM at a site distant from vaccine administration.
*   **Clinical Use/Dosing (PrEP & PEP):**

    **1. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)**
    *   **Indications:** Recommended for individuals at high or frequent risk of rabies exposure, such as:
        *   Veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and other veterinary staff.
        *   Animal control officers and wildlife handlers.
        *   Rabies laboratory workers and researchers.
        *   Spelunkers (cave explorers) in areas with bat rabies.
        *   Travelers planning to spend extended periods (e.g., >1 month) in areas with enzootic rabies, especially if access to timely and appropriate PEP may be limited.
    *   **Primary PrEP Schedule (Imovax® or RabAvert®):**
        *   Two 1.0 mL IM doses, administered on Day 0 and Day 7.
        *   (Note: This is the current ACIP recommended 2-dose schedule as of 2022. Older 3-dose schedules may still be encountered but the 2-dose schedule is now preferred for most individuals needing PrEP).
    *   **Booster Recommendations for PrEP (Based on risk category and antibody titers if applicable):**
        *   The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated PrEP recommendations in 2022 to a primary 2-dose series (Day 0, Day 7). Previous 3-dose PrEP schedules (e.g., Day 0, 7, 21-28) are still considered valid immunization history.
        *   **Risk Category 1 (Infrequent Risk, e.g., most international travelers to rabies-enzootic areas):** After a complete 2-dose primary PrEP series, no routine titer checks or booster doses are recommended.
        *   **Risk Category 2 (Frequent Risk, e.g., veterinarians, veterinary staff, animal control officers in rabies-enzootic areas, bat handlers/spelunkers):**
            *   Option 1: One-time rabies antibody titer check 1–3 years after the initial 2-dose PrEP series. If titer is <0.5 IU/mL, administer a single booster dose. If titer is ≥0.5 IU/mL, no booster needed at that time; subsequent boosters based on exposure risk or future titer checks.
            *   Option 2: Administer a one-time booster dose 3 weeks to 3 years after the initial 2-dose PrEP series. No further routine titer checks or boosters are then needed for this risk category unless a specific exposure occurs.
        *   **Risk Category 3 (Sustained Risk, e.g., rabies researchers, diagnostic laboratory workers, vaccine production workers):** Rabies antibody titer check every 6 months. Administer a booster dose if titer falls below 0.5 IU/mL.

    **2. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**
    *   **Indications:** PEP is recommended for any individual bitten, scratched, or exposed via mucous membranes or non-intact skin to saliva or neural tissue of a confirmed or suspected rabid animal (mammal).
    *   **PEP Management ALWAYS includes:**
        1.  **Immediate and Thorough Wound Care:** This is a critical first step. Vigorously wash all bite wounds and scratches with soap and water for at least 15 minutes. If available, a virucidal agent such as povidone-iodine or 70% ethanol should be applied to the wound after washing.
        2.  **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) Administration:** If the patient has not been previously vaccinated against rabies (see below). Administer on Day 0 of the PEP series.
            *   **Product:** Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG) – e.g., HyperRAB® S/D, Kedrab®.
            *   **Dose:** 20 IU/kg body weight.
            *   **Administration:** Infiltrate as much of the calculated HRIG dose as is anatomically feasible directly into and around the wound(s). Administer any remaining volume intramuscularly (IM) at a site distant from vaccine administration (e.g., contralateral limb).
            *   If HRIG was not administered when vaccination was begun (Day 0), it can be administered up to and including Day 7 after the first dose of vaccine was given. Beyond Day 7, HRIG is not indicated as an endogenous antibody response to the vaccine is presumed to have begun.
        3.  **Rabies Vaccine Series:** Administer IM in the deltoid area (or anterolateral thigh in young children).
            *   **For Previously Unvaccinated Individuals:** Administer four 1.0 mL IM doses of rabies vaccine (HDCV or PCECV). One dose is given on Day 0, and one dose on Days 3, 7, and 14.
            *   **For Previously Vaccinated Individuals:** (Defined as those with a documented history of complete PrEP with HDCV or PCECV, prior PEP with HDCV or PCECV, or a previous documented rabies antibody titer ≥0.5 IU/mL). Administer two 1.0 mL IM doses of rabies vaccine. One dose on Day 0 and one dose on Day 3. **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) should NOT be given to previously vaccinated persons.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PEP for Immunocompromised Individuals:** Regardless of prior rabies vaccination status, immunocompromised persons who experience a potential rabies exposure should receive a 5-dose vaccine schedule (Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28) **plus** Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) on Day 0. Serologic testing post-vaccination (e.g., 1-2 weeks after the final dose) is also advised to confirm an adequate immune response (titer ≥0.5 IU/mL).

*   **Patient Education:**
    *   **Pre-Vaccination (PrEP or PEP):**
        *   Provide and review the CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for rabies vaccine.
        *   Clearly explain the reason for vaccination (PrEP based on risk assessment or PEP due to a specific exposure event).
        *   Thoroughly discuss the dosing schedule and emphasize the critical importance of adhering to and completing the entire prescribed series for optimal protection.
        *   Inform about common adverse reactions: local injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, itching) and mild systemic symptoms (headache, nausea, muscle aches, dizziness, low-grade fever). Reassure that these are usually mild and transient.
        *   Advise on comfort measures: acetaminophen or NSAIDs (if appropriate and no contraindications) for pain or fever; cool compress for local reactions.
    *   **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Specifics:**
        *   Re-emphasize the critical importance of immediate and thorough wound care as the first line of defense.
        *   Explain the distinct roles of Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) – providing immediate, passive protection – and the rabies vaccine series – stimulating long-term, active protection.
        *   Stress that adherence to the complete PEP schedule (both RIG if indicated, and all vaccine doses) is essential for preventing this fatal disease.
    *   **When to Seek Medical Care:**
        *   Advise to seek immediate medical attention for signs of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/throat, dizziness, rapid heartbeat).
        *   Report any high fever, severe or persistent systemic symptoms, or any concerning neurological symptoms (e.g., weakness, paralysis, paresthesias) that develop after vaccination.
    *   **Animal Contact & Prevention (General and for PrEP recipients in high-risk professions):**
        *   Educate on avoiding contact with unfamiliar domestic animals and all wild animals, especially those behaving strangely.
        *   Do not attempt to feed or handle wild animals.
        *   Ensure pets are up-to-date on rabies vaccinations.
        *   Report animal bites or potential exposures to local health authorities.
        *   For those in high-risk professions (PrEP recipients), reinforce adherence to occupational safety guidelines and safe animal handling practices.
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   Ensure accurate recording of the vaccine name (Imovax® or RabAvert®), manufacturer, lot number, expiration date, administration site(s), and date(s) for all doses of vaccine and RIG administered. This should be in the patient's permanent medical record and any applicable immunization registry.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** Serologic testing for rabies antibody titers is recommended for certain risk categories to determine the need for booster doses (as detailed in the PrEP Booster Recommendations section above).
    *   **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Post-vaccination serologic testing is **not** routinely recommended for immunocompetent individuals who receive PEP according to ACIP guidelines (i.e., appropriate wound care, RIG if indicated, and the full vaccine series).
        *   Serologic testing (to confirm a titer ≥0.5 IU/mL) may be considered for immunocompromised individuals or if there were significant deviations from the recommended PEP regimen (e.g., incomplete vaccine series, uncertainty about RIG administration).

## Issues in Immunization

This section addresses key considerations and standards related to immunization practices for various populations, adapted from common clinical guidelines and recommendations.

### A. Childhood Immunization

Ideally, immunizations should be given as a part of comprehensive child health care. Childhood immunizations are widely recognized as a highly cost-effective method of preventing infectious diseases. Identified barriers to childhood immunization include:

1.  **Financial Barriers:** Low socioeconomic status can place a child at risk of underimmunization.
2.  **Family Structure & Dynamics:** Issues such as disrupted family structure, parental stress, or lack of social support can impact immunization uptake.
3.  **Perceived Attitudes & Beliefs:** Parental beliefs regarding the benefits (or risks) of immunization, including vaccine hesitancy influenced by misinformation.
4.  **Provider Policies and Practices:** Missed opportunities for vaccination during clinic visits (e.g., not assessing status at every visit, not co-administering all eligible vaccines).
5.  **Social Determinants of Health:** Factors including rural or underserved populations, parental education levels, transportation difficulties, and overall access to healthcare services.

### B. Standards for Child and Adolescent Immunization Practices
*(Adapted from National Vaccine Advisory Committee, 2013 and other guiding bodies)*

These standards aim to ensure that all children and adolescents are appropriately vaccinated and protected against vaccine-preventable diseases.

#### 1. Availability of Vaccines
*   Vaccination services should be readily available and accessible to all children and adolescents.
*   Vaccinations should be coordinated with other essential health-care services and ideally provided within a medical home.
*   Barriers to vaccination (e.g., financial, logistical, cultural) should be actively identified and minimized.
*   Patient costs for vaccines and their administration should be minimized or eliminated (e.g., through programs like Vaccines for Children - VFC).

#### 2. Assessment of Vaccination Status
*   Health-care professionals must review the vaccination status and overall health status of patients at every encounter (well-child visits, acute care visits, hospitalizations) to determine which vaccines are indicated.
*   Health-care professionals should assess for valid medical contraindications and precautions, following only medically indicated reasons for deferring or not administering a vaccine. Invalid contraindications should not impede vaccination.
*   Providers should conduct regular (e.g., semiannual or annual) audits of their patient population to assess immunization coverage levels and to review immunization records for accuracy and completeness.

#### 3. Effective Communication About Vaccine Benefits and Risks
*   Parents/guardians and, as appropriate, patients themselves should be educated about the benefits of vaccination and the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases, as well as the risks associated with vaccines.
*   Communication should be culturally appropriate, tailored to health literacy levels, and delivered in an easy-to-understand language, addressing any concerns or questions.
*   Provide Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) for each vaccine administered, as required by law, and ensure they are understood.

#### 4. Proper Storage, Administration of Vaccines, and Documentation
*   Health-care professionals must follow appropriate and up-to-date procedures for vaccine storage and handling to maintain vaccine potency (e.g., proper temperature monitoring, cold chain management).
*   Current, written vaccination protocols should be accessible at all locations where vaccines are administered.
*   Persons who administer vaccines and staff who manage or support vaccine administration must be knowledgeable about vaccine recommendations and administration techniques and receive ongoing education and training.
*   Health-care professionals should simultaneously administer as many indicated vaccine doses as possible during a single visit, following recommended guidelines for co-administration.
*   Vaccination records for patients must be accurate, complete, easily accessible, and permanent. This includes documenting in patient charts and state/local immunization information systems (IIS) where available.
*   Health-care professionals must report clinically significant adverse events following vaccination promptly and accurately to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). They should also be aware of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).
*   All healthcare personnel who have contact with patients should be appropriately vaccinated according to ACIP recommendations for healthcare providers.

#### 5. Implementation of Strategies to Improve Vaccination Coverage
*   Utilize systems to remind parents/guardians, patients, and health-care professionals when vaccinations are due and to recall those who are overdue for vaccinations (e.g., through IIS, electronic health records, phone calls, text messages).
*   Conduct office- or clinic-based patient record reviews and vaccination coverage assessments annually to identify areas for improvement.
*   Health-care professionals should engage in community-based approaches and collaborations to promote vaccination and address local barriers.

### C. Standards for Adult Immunization Practices
*(Adapted from National Vaccine Advisory Committee, 2014 and other guiding bodies)*

These standards aim to ensure adults are also protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.

#### 1. Make Vaccinations Available
*   Adult vaccination services should be readily available and accessible in various settings (e.g., primary care, pharmacies, workplaces, community health centers).
*   Barriers to receiving vaccines (e.g., cost, lack of insurance, transportation, inconvenient hours, misinformation, lack of provider recommendation) should be identified and minimized.
*   Patient "out-of-pocket" vaccination costs should be minimized or eliminated through insurance coverage, public health programs, or other means.

#### 2. Assess Patients' Vaccination Status
*   Health-care professionals should routinely review the vaccination status of adult patients at every appropriate clinical encounter (e.g., annual check-ups, new patient visits, hospitalizations, specialty care visits).
*   Health-care professionals must accurately assess for valid contraindications and precautions to vaccination, avoiding missed opportunities due to misinterpretation of contraindications.

#### 3. Communicate Effectively with Patients
*   Patients should be educated about the benefits of vaccination, the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases, and the potential risks and side effects of vaccines in clear, easy-to-understand language.
*   Address patient questions and concerns respectfully and provide Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) as appropriate.
*   Utilize motivational interviewing and shared decision-making techniques to encourage vaccine acceptance.

#### 4. Administer and Document Vaccinations Properly
*   Up-to-date, written vaccination protocols should be readily available at all locations where vaccines are administered.
*   Persons who administer vaccines must be properly trained in vaccine administration techniques, emergency procedures for adverse reactions, and current recommendations.
*   Health-care professionals should recommend and offer simultaneous administration of all indicated vaccine doses for which a patient is eligible at a single visit, unless contraindicated.
*   Vaccination records for patients must be accurate, complete, easily accessible, and documented in both the patient's medical record and, where available, in state or local immunization information systems (IIS).
*   All personnel who have contact with patients, especially in healthcare settings, should be appropriately vaccinated according to ACIP recommendations for healthcare personnel.

#### 5. Implement Strategies to Improve Vaccination Rates
*   Systems should be developed and used to remind patients and health-care professionals when vaccinations are due and to recall patients who are overdue (e.g., EHR alerts, patient portals, mail/phone reminders).
*   Standing orders for vaccinations should be employed in practices and healthcare systems to empower nurses and other qualified healthcare personnel to administer vaccines without a direct physician order for each patient, according to pre-approved protocols.
*   Regular assessments of vaccination coverage levels should be conducted in a provider's practice or healthcare system to identify gaps and implement quality improvement measures.

#### 6. Partner with the Community
*   Patient-oriented and community-based approaches should be used to reach target adult populations, including collaborations with employers, pharmacies, community organizations, and public health agencies.

### D. Immunization in Special Populations

Certain populations have unique considerations regarding vaccination due to age, health conditions, or other factors.

#### 1. Pregnant Patients

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides specific guidelines for vaccinating pregnant women. Key considerations include:

*   The risk from vaccination during pregnancy is largely theoretical for inactivated vaccines and toxoids.
*   The benefit of vaccination among pregnant women usually outweighs the potential risk when:
    *   The risk for disease exposure is high (e.g., during an influenza season or an outbreak).
    *   Infection would pose a special risk for the mother or fetus (e.g., influenza, pertussis).
    *   The vaccine is unlikely to cause harm (e.g., inactivated vaccines).

> [!WARNING]
> Generally, live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, Varicella, LAIV) are contraindicated in pregnant women because of the theoretical risk of transmission of vaccine virus to the fetus. If a woman is inadvertently given a live virus vaccine while pregnant, she should be counseled about the potential effects on the fetus. Termination of pregnancy is not typically recommended based solely on inadvertent live vaccine administration.

**Recommendations for Vaccination During Pregnancy Include the Following:**

| Vaccine                     | May Be Given if Indicated | Contraindicated During Pregnancy | Comments                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routine Vaccines**        |                            |                                  |                                                                                                                                        |
| COVID-19                    |             X              |                                  | Recommended for all pregnant individuals. Can be given at any point in pregnancy.                                                      |
| Hepatitis A                 |             X              |                                  | If at risk for infection (e.g., travel to endemic area, close contact with infected person, chronic liver disease) or severe outcome from infection during pregnancy. |
| Hepatitis B                 |             X              |                                  | The theoretical risk to the fetus is low from the inactivated vaccine. Recommended for those at risk (e.g., HBsAg-negative with >1 sex partner in last 6 months, IV drug use, household contact with HBV infection). |
| Human papillomavirus (HPV)  |                            |         X (Defer Series)         | Not recommended during pregnancy; vaccination series should be deferred until after pregnancy. If inadvertently started, delay remaining doses. |
| Influenza (inactivated)     |             X              |                                  | Recommended for all women who are or will be pregnant during influenza season, regardless of trimester.                                |
| Influenza (LAIV)            |                            |                X                 | Live attenuated vaccine.                                                                                                               |
| MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) |                            |                X                 | Live attenuated vaccine. Women of childbearing age should be assessed for rubella immunity and vaccinated if not immune and not pregnant (wait 1 month after MMR before attempting pregnancy). |
| Meningococcal (MenACWY)     |             X              |                                  | Administer if indicated (e.g., during an outbreak, travel to endemic area, anatomic or functional asplenia, persistent complement component deficiency, HIV infection, or other risk factors). Safety data are limited but suggest no adverse fetal outcomes. |
| Meningococcal B (MenB)      |                            |            Precaution            | Delay until after pregnancy unless at increased risk (e.g., outbreak, complement deficiency, asplenia) and benefits of vaccination are considered to outweigh potential risks. Discuss with provider. |
| PCV (conjugate: PCV13/15/20) |             X              |                                  | No routine recommendation during pregnancy. May be given if indicated due to underlying medical conditions or other risk factors; consult specific ACIP recommendations. |
| PPSV23 (polysaccharide)     |             X              |                                  | No routine recommendation during pregnancy. May be given if indicated due to underlying medical conditions (e.g., 19-64 years with chronic heart/lung/liver disease, diabetes, alcoholism, smoking); consult specific ACIP recommendations. |
| Polio (IPV - inactivated)   |             X              |                                  | If at increased risk of exposure and not adequately vaccinated previously. |
| Td (Tetanus, diphtheria)    |             X              |                                  | Tdap is preferred if no prior Tdap or if pertussis protection is needed. Td can be used as a booster if Tdap is not indicated or available. |
| Tdap (Tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis) |             X              |                                  | **Strongly Recommended:** Administer **one dose of Tdap during each pregnancy**, ideally between 27 and 36 weeks gestation, to maximize maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant for protection against pertussis. |
| Varicella (Chickenpox)      |                            |                X                 | Live attenuated vaccine. Counsel non-immune pregnant women to avoid exposure. Postpartum vaccination recommended. |
| Zoster (Shingles)           |                            |                X                 | Recombinant (RZV) and live attenuated (ZVL - no longer available/preferred) vaccines. RZV has not been studied in pregnancy. Defer RZV until postpartum. |
| **Travel and Other Vaccines** |                            |                                  |                                                                                                                                        |
| Anthrax                     |                            |         X (generally)          | Vaccinate only if benefits clearly outweigh risks to fetus (e.g., unavoidable high-risk exposure scenario). Consult public health authorities. |
| BCG (Tuberculosis)          |                            |                X                 | Live attenuated vaccine. Contraindicated due to theoretical risk to fetus. |
| Japanese Encephalitis (JE)  |      X (if high risk)      |                                  | The vaccine should not be routinely administered during pregnancy. Consider only if travel to an area with high risk of JE exposure is unavoidable and benefits outweigh risks. IXIARO® is an inactivated vaccine. |
| Rabies                      |             X              |                                  | Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin (RIG) is critical and should **not** be withheld or delayed due to pregnancy if a significant exposure occurs. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can be considered if high ongoing risk. |
| Typhoid (injectable ViPS)   |      X (if indicated)      |                                  | If travel to an area where typhoid is endemic is unavoidable, the inactivated Vi polysaccharide vaccine (ViPS) is preferred over the oral live attenuated vaccine. |
| Typhoid (oral Ty21a)        |                            |                X                 | Live attenuated vaccine. |
| Vaccinia (Smallpox/Mpox)    |                            |         X (JYNNEOS/ACAM2000)     | JYNNEOS (modified live, non-replicating) is generally contraindicated unless benefits outweigh risks in a high-risk exposure scenario (e.g., mpox outbreak). ACAM2000 (live, replicating) is contraindicated. For definite high-risk smallpox exposure, consult CDC. |
| Yellow Fever                |                            |         X (generally)          | Live attenuated vaccine. Only vaccinate if travel to a high-risk area is unavoidable and risk of infection is high, and a waiver cannot be obtained. Weigh risks/benefits carefully; may cause severe disease in mother and potential fetal infection. |

#### 2. Immunocompromised Patients

Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk for vaccine-preventable diseases and may have a suboptimal response to vaccines or be at risk for adverse events from certain vaccines, particularly live vaccines.

For practical considerations, persons with immunocompromising conditions may be divided into three general groups:

1.  **Persons who are severely immunocompromised NOT as a result of HIV infection:**
    *   Examples: Congenital immunodeficiencies (e.g., SCID, DiGeorge syndrome), hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma), solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy, recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) within 24 months post-transplant or with GVHD, individuals on high-dose corticosteroids (≥20 mg/day or ≥2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent for ≥14 days), or other potent immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., alkylating agents, antimetabolites, TNF inhibitors, certain biologics).
    *   **General Rule:** These patients should **NOT** be administered live vaccines (both viral and bacterial) due to the risk of severe or fatal infections from the vaccine strain.
    *   Close contacts (e.g., household members) of severely immunocompromised patients can and should receive most routine vaccines, including MMR and Varicella, as vaccine virus transmission is rare and the risk of natural infection to the immunocompromised patient is higher. However, precautions may apply for oral rotavirus vaccine and LAIV depending on the specific situation.
    *   Passive immunization with immunoglobulin (e.g., VariZIG for varicella exposure, IG for measles exposure) should be considered for susceptible immunocompromised persons instead of or in addition to vaccination following certain exposures.

2.  **Persons with HIV infection:**
    *   Vaccination recommendations depend on the level of immunosuppression, primarily determined by the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage, and viral load.
    *   **General Rule:** Persons known to be HIV-infected should **NOT** receive live virus or live bacteria vaccines if they are severely immunocompromised (typically defined as CD4 count <200 cells/µL or CD4 percentage <15%).
    *   **MMR vaccine:** Recommended for all HIV-infected children and for adults born in 1957 or later without evidence of immunity, if not severely immunocompromised (CD4 count ≥200 cells/µL for ≥6 months).
    *   **Varicella vaccine:** May be considered for HIV-infected individuals (children and adults) who are not severely immunocompromised (CD4 count ≥200 cells/µL for children aged >8 years and adults; CD4% ≥15% for children 1-8 years) and lack evidence of immunity. Requires careful consideration of benefits and risks.
    *   **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV):** Preferred polio vaccine for HIV-infected individuals and their household contacts.
    *   **Pneumococcal vaccines (PCV15/PCV20 and PPSV23):** Indicated for all HIV-infected persons ≥2 years of age. Specific recommendations vary by age and prior pneumococcal vaccination history.
    *   **Annual influenza vaccination (inactivated):** Recommended for all HIV-infected individuals.
    *   Other routine inactivated vaccines are generally recommended as for immunocompetent individuals.

3.  **Persons with conditions that cause limited immune deficits:**
    *   Examples: Anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), chronic renal failure/end-stage renal disease, chronic liver disease (including cirrhosis), diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cochlear implants, CSF leaks.
    *   These individuals are generally not considered severely immunosuppressed for the purposes of most routine vaccinations and can receive both live and inactivated vaccines according to usual schedules.
    *   However, they often require specific vaccines (e.g., enhanced pneumococcal, meningococcal, and *Haemophilus influenzae* type b vaccination for asplenia) or higher doses/modified schedules due to increased risk of certain infections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specific ACIP recommendations for each immunocompromising condition and vaccine should always be consulted, as guidelines are complex, nuanced, and frequently updated. Decisions about vaccination in immunocompromised patients often require consultation with infectious disease or immunology specialists.

#### 3. Travel Immunization

International travel exposes individuals to infectious diseases not commonly encountered in their home country. Proactive planning for travel-related health needs, including immunizations, is crucial.

*   **Pre-Travel Consultation:** Advise patients to consult a healthcare provider or travel clinic at least 4-8 weeks before departure, especially for complex itineraries or travel to developing countries.
*   **Risk Assessment:** The need for specific travel vaccines depends on several factors:
    *   Destination(s) (country, region, urban vs. rural areas)
    *   Duration of travel
    *   Season of travel
    *   Planned activities (e.g., adventure travel, healthcare work, extensive contact with local populations)
    *   Underlying health status of the traveler
    *   Routine immunization status
*   **Resources for Recommendations:**
    *   **CDC Travelers' Health Website:** The most comprehensive and up-to-date resource ([www.cdc.gov/travel](http://www.cdc.gov/travel/)). Provides country-specific recommendations, information on outbreaks, and advice for different types of travelers.
    *   **CDC Yellow Book (Health Information for International Travel):** An authoritative guide published biennially by the CDC.
    *   Local travel medicine clinics often have expertise in this area.
*   **Routine Immunizations:** Ensure all routine, age-appropriate immunizations (e.g., Tdap, MMR, polio, influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19) are up-to-date before travel.
*   **Required vs. Recommended Vaccines:**
    *   **Required:** Yellow fever vaccine may be required for entry into certain countries, often documented with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP or "yellow card"). Meningococcal vaccine may be required for travel to Saudi Arabia during Hajj.
    *   **Recommended:** Many other vaccines are recommended based on risk (e.g., Hepatitis A, Typhoid, Japanese Encephalitis, Rabies, Cholera).
*   **Documentation:** Advise travelers to carry a copy of their immunization records with their travel documents.
*   Other Preventive Measures: Emphasize other important preventive measures such as food and water safety, mosquito bite prevention, and malaria prophylaxis if indicated.

## Zoster Vaccine

Herpes zoster (shingles) is a painful, unilateral vesicular eruption that occurs due to the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). It affects approximately 1 million individuals in the United States annually, with the risk increasing with age. A common and debilitating complication of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), persistent neuropathic pain that can last for months or years.

Two vaccines have been licensed in the US to prevent herpes zoster:
*   **Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL, Zostavax®):** A live attenuated vaccine, licensed in 2006. (No longer available for use in the U.S. as of November 18, 2020).
*   **Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV, Shingrix®):** An adjuvanted, recombinant subunit vaccine, licensed in 2017.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) preferentially recommends the use of **Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV, Shingrix®)** over ZVL (when it was available) due to its significantly higher and more sustained efficacy in preventing herpes zoster and PHN across all age groups for which it is recommended.

### A. Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV, Shingrix®)

#### 1. Pharmacodynamics
*   **Mechanism of Action:** RZV is a non-live, recombinant subunit vaccine containing VZV glycoprotein E (gE) antigen combined with the AS01B adjuvant system. It boosts VZV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, which protects against zoster disease and its complications.
*   **Efficacy:**
    *   Prevention of herpes zoster:
        *   Adults 50-59 years: ~96.6% - 97.2%
        *   Adults 60-69 years: ~97.4% - 97.9%
        *   Adults ≥70 years: ~91.3% - 97.6%
        *   Immunocompromised adults ≥18 years: Efficacy varies by underlying condition but generally ranges from 68% to 91%.
    *   Prevention of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults ≥50 years: ~88.8% - 91.2%.
    *   Duration of protection is long-lasting, with high efficacy maintained for at least 7-10 years post-vaccination in immunocompetent adults.

#### 2. Pharmacokinetics
*   The exact pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) of RZV are not fully characterized, as is typical for vaccines.
*   **Onset of Protection:** Protective immunity develops within a few weeks after completion of the 2-dose series.
*   **Duration of Protection:** Studies indicate high efficacy persists for at least 10 years in immunocompetent adults.

#### 3. Precautions and Contraindications
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   History of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of Shingrix or after a previous dose of Shingrix.
*   **Precautions:**
    *   **Acute Illness:** Vaccination should be delayed in individuals experiencing a moderate or severe acute illness, with or without fever, until the condition improves.
    *   **Current Herpes Zoster Episode:** Shingrix should **not** be administered to a person with an acute episode of herpes zoster. Vaccination should be deferred until the acute illness has resolved and symptoms have abated.
    *   **Pregnancy:** There are no available data on the safety of RZV in pregnant women. Pregnancy testing is not needed before administering RZV. Women known to be pregnant should delay RZV vaccination until after pregnancy. If RZV is inadvertently administered to a pregnant woman, no intervention is needed, but she should be informed about the lack of safety data.
    *   **Lactation:** There are no available data on the safety of RZV in lactating women or on the effects on breastfed infants or milk production/excretion. The benefits of vaccinating the mother should be weighed against potential unknown risks.
*   **Special Populations:**
    *   **Pediatrics:** Safety and effectiveness in children younger than age 18 years have not been determined. RZV is not indicated for the prevention of primary varicella (chickenpox) infection; varicella vaccine should be used for this purpose.

#### 4. Adverse Drug Reactions
Adverse reactions to RZV are common but are generally mild to moderate in intensity and resolve within 2-3 days. Reactogenicity is higher than with some other adult vaccines.
*   **Local Reactions (very common, >70-80%):**
    *   Pain at the injection site
    *   Redness
    *   Swelling
*   **Systemic Reactions (common, >50-60%):**
    *   Myalgia (muscle pain)
    *   Fatigue
    *   Headache
    *   Shivering
    *   Fever
    *   Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain)
*   **Serious Adverse Events:**
    *   **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS):** An increased risk of GBS (approximately 3 cases per 1 million doses administered in adults ≥65 years, and 6 cases per million in one study of adults 50-64 years) has been observed in the 42 days following RZV administration. A causal relationship has not been definitively established. Patients should be counseled about this potential risk.
    *   Anaphylaxis is rare but possible with any vaccine.

#### 5. Drug Interactions
*   There are no known clinically significant drug interactions with RZV.
*   **Coadministration:** RZV can be coadministered with other adult vaccines, such as unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13, PCV15, PCV20, PPSV23), and Tdap vaccine. When coadministering, vaccines should be given at different anatomical sites (e.g., different deltoid muscles).
    *   Coadministration with adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Fluad) may result in increased local and systemic reactions.

#### 6. Clinical Use and Dosing
*   **Immunocompetent Adults:**
    *   **Indication:** Recommended for all immunocompetent adults aged **50 years and older**.
    *   This includes individuals who:
        *   Have previously received ZVL (Zostavax®) - revaccinate with RZV.
        *   Have a history of herpes zoster - RZV helps prevent recurrences.
        *   Are unsure about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or have no documented history of varicella or varicella vaccination (most adults are presumed to be latently infected with VZV).
    *   **Schedule:** Two 0.5 mL doses administered intramuscularly (IM):
        *   First dose: At elected date.
        *   Second dose: **2 to 6 months** after the first dose.
*   **Immunodeficient or Immunosuppressed Adults:**
    *   **Indication:** Recommended for adults aged **18 years and older** who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy.
    *   **Schedule:** Two 0.5 mL doses administered IM:
        *   First dose: At elected date.
        *   Second dose: **1 to 2 months** after the first dose.
        *   This shorter interval is to provide protection more quickly in this vulnerable population.
    *   **Timing with Immunosuppression:** Ideally, RZV should be administered before initiating immunosuppressive therapy, when the immune response is likely to be strongest. If already on immunosuppressive therapy, vaccination can still be beneficial.
*   **Administration Notes:**
    *   Administer intramuscularly, preferably in the deltoid muscle.
    *   If the second dose is administered earlier than the recommended interval, it does not need to be repeated if the minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses has been met.
    *   If more than 6 months (for immunocompetent) or more than 2 months (for immunosuppressed) have passed since the first dose, the second dose should be administered as soon as possible. The series does **not** need to be restarted.

#### 7. Patient Education
*   **Purpose and Benefits:** Explain that Shingrix helps prevent shingles (herpes zoster) and its common, often debilitating complication, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).
*   **Two-Dose Series:** Emphasize the importance of completing the 2-dose series according to the recommended schedule to achieve optimal and durable protection.
*   **Expected Side Effects:**
    *   Counsel patients about common local reactions (pain, redness, swelling at the injection site) and systemic reactions (myalgia, fatigue, headache, fever, shivering, gastrointestinal symptoms).
    *   Inform them that these reactions are generally mild to moderate in intensity, temporary (typically lasting 2-3 days), and self-limiting.
    *   Advise on comfort measures such as using a cool compress on the injection site or taking over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) if appropriate and not contraindicated.
*   **When to Seek Medical Care:**
    *   Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention for signs of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/throat, dizziness, rapid heartbeat).
    *   Inform them about the rare risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and advise to seek medical care if they experience symptoms such as weakness, tingling, or paralysis.
    *   Instruct them to report any other severe or persistent adverse reactions to their healthcare provider.
*   **Important Clarifications:**
    *   Clarify that Shingrix is **not** for preventing primary chickenpox (varicella); the varicella vaccine is used for that purpose.
    *   Inform patients that Shingrix is recommended even if they have had shingles before or previously received the older Zostavax vaccine (which is no longer available in the U.S.).
*   **Vaccine Information Statement (VIS):** Provide and review the current VIS for Shingrix with the patient.

#### 8. Monitoring
*   **Immediate Observation:** Patients should be observed for immediate allergic reactions per standard vaccination practice (typically 15 minutes post-vaccination).
*   **Routine Laboratory Monitoring:** There is no ongoing laboratory monitoring (e.g., serologic testing for VZV antibodies) routinely required or recommended after RZV vaccine administration.
*   **Adverse Events:** Monitor for and report any clinically significant adverse events following vaccination promptly and accurately to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
*   **Completion of Series:** Healthcare providers should track and remind patients to complete the 2-dose series according to the recommended schedule.

## Immunoglobulin Serums

Immunoglobulin (IG) serums provide passive immunity to infectious diseases by administering pre-formed antibodies. The choice of IG product is determined by the types of products available, the specific type of antibody desired, the route of administration, timing relative to exposure, and other clinical considerations.

### A. Overview of Immunoglobulin Products

Common IG products that may be used in primary care and other settings include:

*   **Immunoglobulin Intramuscular (IGIM):** e.g., GamaSTAN S/D
*   **Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG):** e.g., HepaGam B®, Nabi-HB®
*   **Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG):** e.g., HyperTET S/D®
*   **Varicella Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG):** e.g., VARIZIG®
*   **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG):** e.g., HyperRAB S/D®, Imogam Rabies HT®
*   **Rho(D) Immunoglobulin:** e.g., RhoGAM®, HyperRHO S/D Full Dose®, WinRho SDF®
*   **Botulism Immunoglobulin Intravenous (BIG-IV, BabyBIG®)**
*   **Vaccinia Immunoglobulin Intravenous (VIGIV)**

> [!NOTE]
> Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immunoglobulin (RSV-IGIV) is no longer available in the U.S. Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used for RSV prophylaxis in high-risk infants and young children.

### B. General Pharmacodynamics of Immunoglobulins

Immunoglobulins are derived from the pooled plasma of thousands of adult human donors. The manufacturing process typically involves methods such as cold ethanol fractionation. Key characteristics include:

*   **Composition:** They consist primarily of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction (≥90-95% IgG), containing a broad spectrum of antibodies representative of the donor population's exposure and immunization history.
*   **Safety:** Manufacturing processes include steps for viral inactivation and removal, making the risk of transmitting bloodborne pathogens (e.g., hepatitis viruses, HIV) extremely low.
*   **Mechanism:** IGs provide immediate, temporary (passive) immunity by supplying pre-formed antibodies. The protection lasts until the antibodies are catabolized, typically for a few weeks to several months.
*   **Standard vs. Specific IGs:**
    *   **Standard IGIM (Immune Globulin Intramuscular, formerly called gamma globulin):** Contains a diverse range of antibodies reflecting the general population.
    *   **Specific IGs (Hyperimmune Globulins):** Prepared from plasma pools selected for high titers of specific antibodies against a particular antigen or microorganism (e.g., HBIG has high anti-HBs titers; TIG has high anti-tetanus toxin titers).

### C. Specific Immunoglobulin Products: Pharmacodynamics and Key Uses

#### 1. Immunoglobulin Intramuscular (IGIM) (e.g., GamaSTAN S/D®)
*   **Description:** A sterile, concentrated solution of IgG antibodies.
*   **Mechanism:** Provides passive protection against certain viral infections through pre-formed antibodies.
*   **Key Uses:**
    *   **Hepatitis A:** Pre-exposure prophylaxis for travelers to endemic areas (if vaccine is not an option or insufficient time for series) and post-exposure prophylaxis for susceptible close contacts of acute hepatitis A cases.
    *   **Measles:** Post-exposure prophylaxis for susceptible individuals, especially immunocompromised persons, infants <12 months, and unvaccinated pregnant women.
*   **Source:** Pooled plasma from general adult human donors.

#### 2. Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) (e.g., HepaGam B®, Nabi-HB®)
*   **Description:** A sterile solution of IGs (typically 10-18% protein) containing high titers of antibodies against Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs).
*   **Mechanism:** Provides passive immunity by neutralizing Hepatitis B virus, preventing infection or mitigating disease severity.
*   **Key Uses:**
    *   **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP):** Following percutaneous, mucosal, or sexual exposure to HBsAg-positive blood or body fluids (often given with Hepatitis B vaccine series initiation).
    *   **Perinatal Hepatitis B prevention:** Administered to infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, along with the first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine, within 12 hours of birth.
*   **Source:** Plasma pools from donors with high titers of anti-HBs.

#### 3. Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) (e.g., HyperTET S/D®)
*   **Description:** Prepared from the plasma of adults hyperimmunized with tetanus toxoid, containing high levels of antibodies against tetanus toxin (tetanospasmin).
*   **Mechanism:** Provides passive immunity by neutralizing circulating tetanospasmin before it can bind to nerve tissue, thus preventing or attenuating the clinical manifestations of tetanus.
*   **Key Uses:**
    *   Part of tetanus post-exposure prophylaxis for individuals with tetanus-prone wounds who have an unknown or incomplete (<3 doses) tetanus vaccination history.
    *   Treatment of clinical tetanus (in conjunction with other supportive measures and wound care).
*   **Source:** Plasma from donors hyperimmunized with tetanus toxoid.

#### 4. Varicella-Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG) (e.g., VARIZIG®)
*   **Description:** Derived from human plasma and consists of IgG containing high titers of antibodies to varicella-zoster virus (VZV).
*   **Mechanism:** Provides passive immunization to prevent or attenuate varicella (chickenpox) in susceptible high-risk individuals after exposure to VZV.
*   **Key Uses (Post-exposure prophylaxis for susceptible high-risk individuals):**
    *   Immunocompromised children and adults without evidence of VZV immunity.
    *   Pregnant women without evidence of VZV immunity.
    *   Newborns whose mothers develop varicella from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery.
    *   Hospitalized premature infants born at ≤28 weeks gestation or weighing ≤1000g, regardless of maternal immune status.
    *   Hospitalized premature infants born at >28 weeks gestation whose mothers lack evidence of VZV immunity.
*   **Source:** Human plasma with high anti-VZV antibody titers.

#### 5. Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) (e.g., HyperRAB S/D®, Imogam Rabies HT®)
*   **Description:** Primarily gamma globulin containing high titers of rabies antibodies.
*   **Mechanism:** Provides immediate passive immunity by neutralizing the rabies virus at the site of exposure and retarding its spread, offering protection until the patient's immune system actively responds to rabies vaccine.
*   **Key Uses:**
    *   Administered as part of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for individuals exposed to potentially rabid animals. As much of the dose as feasible is infiltrated around and into the wound(s), with any remainder given IM at a site distant from vaccine administration.
*   **Source:** Plasma from humans hyperimmunized with rabies vaccine.

#### 6. Rho(D) Immunoglobulin (e.g., RhoGAM®, WinRho SDF®)
*   **Description:** A solution containing IgG antibodies against the erythrocyte antigen Rho(D).
*   **Mechanism:** Prevents isoimmunization in Rho(D)-negative women. The administered anti-Rho(D) antibodies are believed to bind to any Rho(D)-positive fetal red blood cells that may have entered the maternal circulation, effectively 'hiding' them from the mother's immune system and preventing her from developing her own anti-Rho(D) antibodies.
*   **Key Uses:**
    *   Routine antepartum administration to Rho(D)-negative pregnant women (typically around 28 weeks gestation).
    *   Postpartum administration to Rho(D)-negative women who have delivered an Rho(D)-positive infant.
    *   Following any event that could lead to fetomaternal hemorrhage in an Rho(D)-negative woman (e.g., miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, abdominal trauma, external cephalic version).
    *   Prevention of Rho(D) alloimmunization in Rho(D)-negative individuals inadvertently transfused with Rho(D)-positive blood products.
*   **Goal:** Prevents the development of Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN), formerly known as erythroblastosis fetalis, in current or subsequent pregnancies with an Rho(D)-positive fetus.
*   **Source:** Plasma from human donors with high titers of anti-Rho(D) antibodies.

#### 7. Botulism Immunoglobulin Intravenous (BIG-IV / BabyBIG®)
*   **Description:** Provides immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from the plasma of adults immunized with botulinum toxoid types A and B.
*   **Mechanism:** Contains antibodies that neutralize circulating botulinum neurotoxins type A and type B before they can bind to nerve endings.
*   **Key Uses:** Treatment of infant botulism (affecting patients <1 year of age) caused by toxin types A or B.
*   **Source:** Plasma from adults immunized with botulinum toxoid.

#### 8. Vaccinia Immunoglobulin Intravenous (VIGIV)
*   **Description:** A solution of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) containing high titers of antibodies against vaccinia virus.
*   **Mechanism:** Provides passive immunity by supplying neutralizing antibodies against vaccinia virus.
*   **Key Uses:** Treatment of certain complications arising from vaccinia (smallpox) vaccination, such as:
    *   Eczema vaccinatum
    *   Progressive vaccinia (vaccinia necrosum)
    *   Severe generalized vaccinia
    *   Certain other active vaccinia virus infections in individuals with underlying skin conditions or other contraindications to continued viral replication.
*   **Source:** Plasma from individuals recently immunized with vaccinia vaccine who have high titers of anti-vaccinia antibodies.

### D. General Pharmacokinetics of Immunoglobulins

*   **Immunoglobulin Intramuscular (IGIM):**
    *   **Absorption & Onset:** Slowly absorbed after IM injection.
    *   **Duration of Protection (Hepatitis A pre-exposure):** A standard dose (0.02 mL/kg) confers protection for approximately 3 months; larger doses (0.06 mL/kg) can extend protection up to 5 months.
    *   **Efficacy (Hepatitis A post-exposure):** >85% effective if given within 2 weeks after exposure.
    *   **Efficacy (Measles post-exposure):** Can prevent or modify measles if used within 6 days of exposure.
*   **Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG):**
    *   **Absorption & Peak:** Slowly absorbed after IM administration; antibodies typically appear in 1-6 days, with peak levels reached in 3-9 days.
    *   **Duration:** Antibodies remain in serum for up to 2 months.
    *   **Distribution:** Likely crosses the placenta and may be distributed in breast milk.
*   **Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG):**
    *   **Absorption & Peak:** Given IM; peak IgG levels occur approximately 2 days after administration.
    *   **Half-life:** Approximately 3.5 to 4.5 weeks (23-28 days).
*   **Varicella-Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG):**
    *   **Absorption & Peak:** Administered IM; peak IgG levels obtained approximately 2-5 days after administration.
    *   **Timing for Efficacy:** Most effective if administered as soon as possible after VZV exposure, ideally within 96 hours, but may be effective up to 10 days post-exposure.
    *   **Duration of Protection:** Antibody protection lasts for at least 3 weeks.
*   **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG):**
    *   **Administration:** Infiltrated into and around wound(s) if feasible; remainder given IM at a site distant from vaccine.
    *   **Onset:** Provides immediate passive antibodies.
*   **Rho(D) Immunoglobulin:**
    *   **Peak Levels:** Approximately 5-10 days after IM administration.
    *   **Detectability:** Anti-Rho(D) antibodies generally not detectable 6 months after a standard 300 mcg dose.
*   **Botulism Immunoglobulin Intravenous (BIG-IV / BabyBIG®):**
    *   **Half-life:** Reported as approximately 28 days in infants.
*   **Vaccinia Immunoglobulin Intravenous (VIGIV):**
    *   **Peak Levels:** Achieved rapidly after IV infusion (e.g., within 2 hours).
    *   **Half-life:** Reported as approximately 22-30 days.

### E. General Pharmacotherapeutics of Immunoglobulins

#### 1. Precautions and Contraindications
*   **Allergic Reactions:** A history of a severe allergic response (e.g., anaphylaxis) to IG serums or any of their components (e.g., thimerosal, if present) is a contraindication.
*   **Selective IgA Deficiency:**
    *   Patients with selective IgA deficiency who have developed antibodies against IgA (anti-IgA antibodies) are at increased risk for severe anaphylactic or systemic reactions to pooled IG products that contain IgA.
    *   If IG administration is deemed necessary for such patients, products with very low IgA content should be considered, and administration must occur in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis.
*   **Interaction with Live-Virus Vaccines:**
    *   IG administration can interfere with the immune response to live-virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella, live attenuated influenza, rotavirus, yellow fever).
    *   These vaccines should generally not be administered concurrently with or for a specific interval *after* IG administration. The recommended interval varies from 3 to 11 months or longer, depending on the specific IG product, dose, and the vaccine.
    *   Always consult current ACIP recommendations or product labeling for specific interval guidance.
    *   If a live vaccine was given shortly *before* IG, the vaccine dose may need to be repeated after the recommended interval, or serologic testing may be considered to ensure immunity.
*   **Pregnancy:** Generally not a contraindication when clearly indicated. The benefits of IG administration often outweigh potential risks in situations like post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies or hepatitis B.
*   **Specific Product Contraindications:**
    *   **BIG-IV (BabyBIG®):** Not indicated for adults or children older than 12 months. Safety and efficacy are not established for children ≥1 year.
    *   **VIGIV:** Contraindicated in patients with isolated vaccinia keratitis due to the risk of increased corneal scarring.

> [!WARNING]
> **VIGIV and Blood Glucose Monitoring:** VIGIV contains maltose, which can cause falsely high blood glucose readings with certain types of blood glucose testing systems (e.g., those using glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase methods). If VIGIV is administered to a patient requiring blood glucose monitoring, testing should be performed using a glucose-specific method (e.g., glucose oxidase, glucose hexokinase, or glucose dehydrogenase nicotine adenine dinucleotide–based tests) to avoid erroneous results and potential mismanagement of glucose levels.

#### 2. Adverse Drug Reactions
*   **Local Reactions (common with IM administration):**
    *   Tenderness, pain, erythema, and induration at the injection site.
    *   These reactions are usually mild and may last for several hours.
*   **Systemic Reactions (more common with IV, but can occur with IM):**
    *   **Mild to Moderate:** Flushing, headache, myalgia, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, urticaria, angioedema.
    *   **Rare but Serious:**
        *   Anaphylactic reactions (especially in IgA-deficient individuals with anti-IgA antibodies).
        *   Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS).
        *   Renal dysfunction or acute renal failure (particularly with sucrose-stabilized IVIG products, though less common now).
        *   Thromboembolic events.
        *   Hemolysis.

#### 3. Drug Interactions
*   **Live Virus Vaccines:** As detailed in Precautions, IG serums interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines. Specific timing intervals must be observed. Consult current ACIP guidelines for detailed recommendations.

*IM, intramuscular; IV, intravenous. Dosing and indications should always be confirmed with current package inserts and ACIP recommendations.*

### G. Monitoring for Immunoglobulin Therapy

*   **General Monitoring:** Laboratory monitoring is generally not necessary for most IG serum administrations.
*   **Rho(D) Immunoglobulin:** The patient's Rh status and antibody screen should be determined before administering Rho(D) immunoglobulin.
*   **BIG-IV (BabyBIG®):** Patients who receive BIG-IV for infant botulism should be monitored for clinical response and relapse of botulism, as relapse may occur up to 1 month after administration.
*   **IV Administration:** Monitor for acute adverse reactions (e.g., changes in vital signs, infusion reactions) during and immediately after IV administration of IG products.
*   **Efficacy:** Depending on the indication, monitor for prevention or attenuation of disease (e.g., absence of hepatitis B symptoms after HBIG and vaccine).

### H. Patient Education for Immunoglobulin Therapy

Patients (or parents/guardians) should receive comprehensive information regarding the benefits and risks of the specific IG serum before administration. Address any questions or concerns.

Key points for patient education include:

*   **Reason for Administration:** Clearly explain why the IG product is being given (e.g., post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis B, prevention of Rh sensitization).
*   **Source and Safety:** Explain that IG products are derived from human plasma and describe the safety measures taken during manufacturing to minimize the risk of transmitting infectious diseases.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Describe the expected benefits (e.g., prevention or reduction in severity of a specific disease) and emphasize the temporary nature of passive immunity provided by IGs.
*   **Administration:** Explain how the IG will be given (e.g., IM injection, IV infusion).
*   **Common Adverse Reactions:** Discuss common, usually mild, adverse reactions, such as pain, tenderness, or erythema at the injection site for IM products, or potential mild systemic effects like headache or low-grade fever.
*   **Signs of Severe Reactions:** Educate on signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/throat, dizziness) or other serious adverse events, and instruct when to seek immediate medical attention.
*   **Potential Interference with Live Virus Vaccines:** Inform patients that IG products can interfere with the body's response to live virus vaccines. Provide specific advice on timing of future live vaccinations based on the IG product received, or advise them to inform other healthcare providers about the recent IG administration.
*   **Reporting Adverse Events:** Encourage reporting of any concerning side effects.

## Diagnostic Biologicals

The diagnostic biological agent that is commonly used in primary care is tuberculin PPD. PPD is used to screen asymptomatic individuals for infection with M. tuberculosis.

### A. Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD)

Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) is used as an aid in the diagnosis of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection. It is a skin test used to screen asymptomatic individuals.

#### 1. Pharmacodynamics
*   **Mechanism:** PPD is administered intradermally. Individuals who have been previously infected with *M. tuberculosis* (even if latent and asymptomatic) develop a cell-mediated (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction to mycobacterial antigens.
*   **Reaction:** In sensitized individuals, this reaction manifests as induration (hardening) and erythema (redness) at the site of PPD administration, typically peaking at 48-72 hours.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   A positive PPD test (induration of a certain size, dependent on risk factors) indicates that the person has been infected with *M. tuberculosis* at some point.
    *   It does **not** distinguish between active tuberculosis disease and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).
    *   A positive test warrants further evaluation (e.g., symptom screen, chest X-ray, and potentially sputum tests) to rule out active TB disease.

#### 2. Pharmacotherapeutics

##### a. Precautions and Contraindications
*   **Known Positive Reactors:** Do not administer PPD to individuals known to be tuberculin-positive reactors. They may experience severe reactions, including vesiculation, ulceration, and necrosis at the administration site.
*   **Administration Route:** Avoid subcutaneous (SC) administration, as this may lead to a general febrile reaction or acute local inflammation without a readable skin test result.
*   **Immunodeficiency:** Skin testing in immunodeficient individuals (e.g., HIV infection with low CD4 counts, those on immunosuppressive drugs) may not be accurate (false negative) because their cell-mediated immune responsiveness may be suppressed or anergic.
*   **Recent Live Virus Vaccination:** PPD reactivity can be temporarily suppressed by recent live virus vaccination (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, varicella). If PPD testing is needed, it should be done on the same day as live virus vaccination or deferred for 4-6 weeks after vaccination.
*   **Overwhelming TB Infection or Other Illnesses:** Severe or disseminated TB, other viral/bacterial infections, or malnutrition can also suppress PPD reactivity.
*   **Older Adults:** Skin test responsiveness may be delayed or reduced in older adult patients.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** PPD testing is considered safe and valid during pregnancy and lactation.
*   **Children:** Safe in children of all ages, including infants.

##### b. Adverse Drug Reactions
*   **Common/Expected:** A minimal amount of bleeding at the administration site is common and not a concern. Mild itching, discomfort, or erythema at the site.
*   **Highly Sensitive Individuals:** In individuals with a high degree of tuberculin sensitivity, more pronounced reactions can occur, including:
    *   Vesiculation (blister formation)
    *   Ulceration
    *   Necrosis (tissue death) at the administration site.
    *   Pain, significant itching.
*   **Systemic Reactions:** Rare, but may include fever, lymphadenopathy.

##### c. Drug Interactions
*   Live-virus vaccines (MMR, varicella) can suppress the reaction to PPD if given 4 to 6 weeks before the PPD. PPD can be administered at the time that MMR and varicella vaccines are administered.
*   Patients who have been vaccinated with BCG generally are sensitive to PPD.
*   Immunosuppressant medications can suppress the reaction to PPD testing.

##### d. Clinical Use and Dosing
*   The Mantoux PPD test containing 5 tuberculin units (TU) is the preferred test because the interpretation of the reaction has been standardized. Previously, multiple puncture tests were used, and there were many problems with interpretation.
*   The test consists of injecting 5 TU of PPD intradermally. A small white bleb should appear at the injection site if it is done correctly.
*   Reactions are read in 48 to 72 hours after administration.
*   For patients who may be highly sensitized, a test dose of 1 TU is used.
*   **Two-Step Testing:** The CDC recommends two-step testing of all health care personnel upon hire, because some people with latent TB have a negative reaction when tested years after initial infection. The first test may boost a reaction to the second test. The steps are:
    *   **Step 1:**
        1.  Administer the first PPD skin test.
        2.  If positive, the person is considered infected and needs to be evaluated for TB disease.
        3.  If negative, the person needs a second TB skin test 1 to 3 weeks after the first skin test.
    *   **Step 2:**
        1.  Administer the second PPD skin test.
        2.  If positive, the person is considered infected and needs to be evaluated for TB disease.
        3.  If negative, the person is not infected.
*   **Interpretation of Results (Induration Size):**
    *   **≥5 mm is POSITIVE in:**
        *   HIV-positive individuals.
        *   Persons with fibrotic lesions on chest x-ray consistent with prior TB.
        *   Recent contacts of an individual with infectious TB disease.
        *   Patients with organ transplants and other immunosuppressed patients (receiving ≥15 mg/day of prednisone for ≥1 month).
    *   **≥10 mm is POSITIVE in:**
        *   Recent arrivals (<5 years) from high-prevalence countries.
        *   Injection drug users (if HIV-seronegative).
        *   Residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, homeless shelters).
        *   Mycobacteriology laboratory personnel.
        *   Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk (e.g., diabetes mellitus, silicosis, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, leukemia, end-stage renal disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, substantial rapid weight loss or chronic malnutrition).
        *   Children <4 years of age, or children and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories.
    *   **≥15 mm is POSITIVE in:**
        *   Persons with no known risk factors for TB.
*   **Preventive Therapy Candidates (High-Incidence Groups with ≥10 mm induration):**
    *   Foreign-born persons from high-prevalence countries.
    *   Medically underserved low-income populations.
    *   Residents of facilities for long-term care.

##### e. Monitoring
*   The PPD skin test should be read by an experienced healthcare professional trained in the proper method of interpreting induration (not just erythema) at 48 to 72 hours after administration.
*   Document the exact measurement of induration in millimeters.

##### f. Patient Education
*   Patients must have an understanding of the reason for PPD testing and why the test must be read in 48 to 72 hours.
*   Explain that a positive test indicates exposure to TB bacteria, not necessarily active disease, and further tests will be needed.
*   Inform about common site reactions (mild itching, redness) versus signs of a strong reaction that might need reporting (e.g., blistering, significant pain).
*   Emphasize the importance of returning for the reading at the correct time for accurate interpretation.
*   Adverse reactions are rare in patients who are not already sensitized to TB.
