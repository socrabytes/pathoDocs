### Summary
Primary care providers prescribe immunizations frequently, with pediatric providers prescribing many vaccines daily. Although vaccination is typically associated with children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a number of vaccines for adolescents and adults. A dramatic decrease is seen in vaccinepreventable diseases when mass campaigns are implemented, with cases of diphtheria decreasing 100\%, invasive Haemophilus influenzae decreasing 99\%, pertussis decreasing 86\%, and hepatitis A dropping 93\% (Hinman et al, 2011). A study reviewing weekly reports of infectious diseases in the United States from 1888 to 2011 estimates 103.1 million cases of infectious disease have been prevented since 1924 due to vaccines (van Panhuis et al, 2013).

The immunization schedules may change, but the underlying premise of preventing the spread of infectious disease through mass immunization of susceptible populations does not change. The success of mass vaccination is measured not only in decreased numbers of vaccine-preventable illnesses but also in the resurgence of diseases such as polio and measles when programs are halted (Andre et al, 2008; Conis, 2019; Hinman et al, 2011). The United States, Canada, and the European Union are seeing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases as vaccination rates decrease. This includes measles, which was considered eradicated from the Western Hemisphere in 2000 yet saw a record number of cases, 1,274, in 2019 (Hall et al, 2017; www.cdc.gov/measles). This chapter discusses vaccines, immunoglobulin (IG) serums, and the diagnostic drugs used in primary care, such as purified protein derivative (PPD) for tuberculosis (TB) screening.

## IMMUNIZATIONS 

Vaccination is the single best technique for preventing infectious disease. Vaccines exist for many diseases that affect adults and children. This section of the chapter discusses active immunization with either attenuated or inactivated infective agents, the recommended schedule of immunizations for adults and children, and the true precautions and contraindications to immunization. Issues such as barriers surrounding immunization are discussed, as well as immunization of special populations and travel immunizations.

Vaccines are divided into two types: those that are made from attenuated ("modified-live") or inactivated ("killed") infective agents. Attenuated vaccines include those for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR, PRIORIX); oral polio (OPV); varicella virus (Varivax); yellow fever (YF-Vax); live, attenuated virus influenza vaccine (FluMist); rotavirus (Rotarix, RotaTeq); varicella zoster (Zostavax); cholera (Vaxchora); dengue (Dengvaxia); ebola (Ervebo), mpox (JYNNEOS and ACAM2000); and bacilli Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Inactivated vaccines include those for COVID-19 (Comirnaty, Spikevax, Novavax); diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP, DTaP, DT, Td, Tdap); H. influenzae type B (HIB); hepatitis A and B; influenza (Fluzone); meningococcal (Menactra, Menomune, Trumenba, Bexsero); inactivated polio vaccine (IPV; IPOL); human papillomavirus (Gardasil, Cervarix); pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV23); and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar13, Prevnar 20, Vaxneuvance). Japanese encephalitis virus and plague vaccines are other inactivated vaccines. Typhoid vaccine is available in an inactivated form and an oral live, attenuated form. The pharmacodynamics of each vaccine are discussed according to its category.

## ATTENUATED VACCINES

## INFLUENZA LIVE, ATTENUATED INFLUENZA VACCINE

### Pharmacodynamics

Influenza reaches epidemic levels in the winter months in temperate areas and is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 deaths worldwide annually, with more deaths during pandemics (Tyrrell et al, 2021). Influenza live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4; FluMist Quadrivalent) contains two strains of influenza A and two strains of influenza B, strains of which vary by season. The vaccine is cold-adapted, meaning the virus replicates easily in the mucosa of the nasopharynx, and is temperature-sensitive so it does not replicate effectively at core body temperature ( $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), which is why a nasal spray is effective in producing immunity.

### Pharmacokinetics

LAIV4 (FluMist Quadrivalent) vaccine is administered intranasally, with half of the dose administered in each nostril. In radiolabeled studies, $89.7 \%$ of the vaccine remains in the nasal cavity. After administration of LAIV4, viral shedding measured at 11 days was present in $0.9 \%$ of 19 - to 49 -year-olds and $7 \%$ of children 6 to 23 months of age (MedImmune, 2017).

### Pharmacotherapeutics 

#### Precautions and Contraindications
LAIV is contraindicated in persons with asthma, reactive airways disease, or other chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems; persons with other underlying medical conditions, including such metabolic diseases as diabetes, renal dysfunction, and hemoglobinopathies; and persons with known or suspected immunodeficiency diseases or who are receiving immunosuppressive therapies (MedImmune, 2017). Patients who are immunocompromised or who have HIV should not be vaccinated with LAIV. LAIV should not be administered to patients who have had Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Patients who experience only urticaria (hives) after exposure to eggs may receive any of the influenza vaccines including LAIV (Grohskopf et al, 2022). If a patient requires epinephrine or develops angioedema, respiratory distress, or recurrent vomiting after exposure to eggs, LAIV should not be used (Grohskopf et al, 2022).

Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with influenza LAIV. LAIV may be used in the postpartum period.
Use of live influenza vaccine is contraindicated in children younger than age 2 years owing to significant increased incidence of reactive airway disease and asthma. LAIV is also contraindicated in children aged 2 through 4 years of age who have a diagnosis of asthma or have had an episode of wheezing in the past 12 months. The vaccine is also contraindicated in children or adolescents receiving aspirin or other salicylates because of the association of Reye syndrome with wild-type influenza infection.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

LAIV is usually well tolerated with generally mild and transient adverse effects. Adults in clinical trials of LAIV4 (FluMist Quadrivalent) reported respiratory symptoms at the same rate as LAIV3 (FluMist), with $44 \%$ reporting runny nose or nasal congestion, $28 \%$ headache, $19 \%$ sore throat, $14 \%$ cough, and $10 \%$ reporting muscle aches (MedImmune, 2017). No serious adverse reactions have been reported in either children (older than age 2 years) or adult vaccine recipients.

#### Drug Interactions

The administration of LAIV and concurrent use of antivirals active against influenza A and/or B viruses have not been studied. The manufacturer recommends waiting 48 hours after discontinuing antivirals before administering LAIV.

LAIV should not be administered to children younger than age 17 years on aspirin therapy owing to the theoretical increased risk for Reye syndrome.

LAIV may be concurrently administered with MMR and varicella with no problems noted in developing an immune response. LAIV may be simultaneously administered with any of the inactivated vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Inactivated or live vaccines may be administered the same day as LAIV, but if not administered the same day, the two live vaccines need to be separated by 4 weeks.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

Children and adults aged 2 through 49 years should receive 0.2 mL ( 0.1 mL per nare) of LAIV as soon as it becomes available in the fall. Children aged 2 to 8 years who have not had previous influenza vaccination should receive two doses ( 0.2 mL each) separated by 4 weeks (Grohskopf et al, 2022). Children aged 8 years and younger who have previously received two doses of influenza vaccine in the same year need only one dose ( 0.2 mL ) annually.

LAIV (FluMist Quadrivalent) comes prepackaged in prefilled single-use sprayers. The vaccine is thawed by holding the sprayer in the palm of the hand. It may also be thawed in the refrigerator and stored for up to 24 hours before use. Half of the dose is administered in one nostril while the patient is in an upright position; the second half is then administered in the second nostril.

#### Monitoring

Laboratory monitoring is not necessary after LAIV administration.

#### Patient Education

Because LAIV is a live virus vaccine, recipients should be advised to stay away from close contact with immunocompromised persons for 7 days after administration because the virus may be shed via nasal discharge, although the risk is theoretical. Patients should report serious or moderate reactions, such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, hives, swelling, unusual weakness, and temperature $38.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or higher, to their health-care provider.

## MEASLES, MUMPS, AND RUBELLA VACCINE 

### Pharmacodynamics

Immunization with MMR or measles vaccine alone stimulates the immune system to produce disease-specific antibodies by inducing a subclinical infection with attenuated virus particles. This subclinical infection is not contagious. The vaccine-induced antibodies are capable of virus neutralization by complement activation, induction of cell-mediated immunity, and opsonization. Measles and measles and rubella live virus vaccine (M-RVax II, PRIORIX) is the commonly used combined vaccine. In 2009, Merck discontinued production of single-agent vaccines based on input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), professional societies, and scientific leaders, and included measles virus vaccine (Attenuvax), mumps live virus vaccine (Mumpsvax), and rubella (Meruvax II). In 2005, a vaccine (ProQuad) that added varicella to MMR (MMRV) received licensing; it is discussed in the next section.

### Pharmacokinetics

The MMR vaccine is administered subcutaneously (SC). Antibodies are detectable 2 weeks after injection (rubella may take 2 to 6 weeks) in $95 \%$ of patients vaccinated, and immunity occurs in about 10 days (Marin et al, 2018). Immunity persists for 15 years or more, with permanent immunity developing in most patients. More than $99 \%$ of people who receive two doses of MMR separated by at least 1 month develop evidence of immunity to measles, which is why the current recommendation is for two doses. The effectiveness of two doses of MMR vaccine in preventing mumps ranges from $31.5 \%$ to $95 \%$, with a median effectiveness of $88 \%$ (Krow-Lucal et al, 2022; Marin et al, 2018).

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

MMR contains live, attenuated virus, and virus has been detected for 1 to 4 weeks after vaccination in the pharynx or nose of most patients who receive the vaccine; however, this does not appear to cause virus transmission.

According to the CDC (Marin et al, 2018; McLean et al, 2013), there are relatively few true contraindications to administering MMR vaccine. They include previous anaphylactic reaction to the MMR vaccine or any component of the vaccine, including neomycin (topically or systemically administered) or gelatin (PRIORIX does not contain gelatin). A history of contact dermatitis to neomycin is not a contraindication to MMR. Anaphylactic reaction or hypersensitivity to eggs is no longer a contraindication to MMR.

Immunosuppression can potentiate virus production; therefore, MMR vaccination is not recommended for immunocompromised patients. In patients with HIV infection, MMR vaccine can be administered if the patient is asymptomatic or without evidence of severe immunosuppression (McLean et al, 2013). MMR should not be given to patients who are severely immunocompromised because of cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma or who are on immunosuppressive drug therapy, including high-dose steroids (prednisone greater than $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day or 20 $\mathrm{mg} /$ day in patients weighing more than 10 kg ) or radiation therapy (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2021a; McLean et al, 2013). MMR may be given to close contacts of immunosuppressed patients, including healthcare workers.

MMR vaccination is generally deferred if a patient has a moderate or severe febrile illness and is given when the patient recovers from the acute phase of the illness. Minor illnesses, with or without fever (diarrhea, upper respiratory infection, or otitis media), are not contraindications to MMR vaccination, and vaccination should not be postponed (AAP, 2021b).

Patients who receive blood products should wait 3 months before being administered MMR (CDC, 2013a). MMR should be given at least 2 weeks before immunoglobulin (IG). Patients who receive IG should wait 6 months before being administered MMR (AAP, 2021b).

There is a theoretical possibility of congenital rubella syndrome in the infant if the mother is given rubella vaccine when pregnant. Women should be asked if they are pregnant before administration of MMR and advised to avoid pregnancy for 1 month after administration of the vaccine (Krow-Lucal et al, 2022). Pregnancy in the mother of a patient receiving MMR is not a contraindication. MMR may be administered to breastfeeding women.

The MMR vaccine may be safely administered to children of all ages, although it may not be immunogenic in infants younger than age 12 months. If MMR vaccine is administered to a child younger than age 12 months, then the child should be revaccinated with MMR at 12 to 15 months of age and receive a third dose of MMR at age 4 to 6 years.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions 

Approximately $5 \%$ to $15 \%$ of children develop a fever of at least $103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(39.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ after vaccination with MMR. The fever usually occurs 7 to 12 days after MMR vaccination (McLean et al, 2013). The fever usually lasts 1 to 2 days, and the patient is otherwise asymptomatic. MMR may cause a transient maculopapular rash 7 to 10 days after vaccination in $5 \%$ of patients. MMR vaccine may cause a febrile seizure with the fever that occurs postvaccination, with the highest risk of febrile seizure 6 to 14 days after administration. The risk of febrile seizure is 1 per 3,000 to 4,000 doses of MMR. The risk of febrile seizures is higher if the patient receives MMRV as their first dose of MMR (Schäfer et al, 2022).

Thrombocytopenia is a rare adverse reaction that may occur within 2 months of administration of MMR vaccine. The incidence of thrombocytopenia is 1 case per 1 million doses on passive surveillance in the United States and 1 case per 30,000 to 40,000 doses in prospective studies (McClean et al, 2013). The clinical course of thrombocytopenia is generally benign and transient.

In times of mumps outbreak, a third dose of MMR has been administered with minimal adverse effects, including injection site pain, redness and swelling ( $2 \%$ to $4 \%$ ), muscle or joint aches ( $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ ), and dizziness or light-headedness ( $2 \%$; McClean et al, 2013).

#### Drug Interactions

MMR should not be administered to patients receiving immunosuppressants, including high-dose corticosteroids, interferon, and antineoplastic drugs, because they may have insufficient response to immunization. Patients may remain susceptible despite immunization. The AAP states: "Children receiving $<2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day of prednisone or its equivalent, or $<20 \mathrm{mg} /$ day if they weigh more than 10 kg , can receive attenuated live virus vaccines during corticosteroid treatment" (AAP, 2021a, p. 84). Inhaled corticosteroids are not a contraindication to MMR vaccine (AAP, 2021a).

The MMR vaccine may be inactivated by IG. To avoid inactivation of the attenuated virus, administer the MMR vaccine at least 14 to 30 days before or 6 months after the IG. If IG is being given in preparation for international travel, the MMR vaccine should be administered at least 2 weeks before IG (AAP, 2021b).

MMR is not contraindicated if a PPD was done recently. PPD may be given on the same day as MMR immunization or should be delayed for 4 to 6 weeks after an MMR has been given because it may interfere with the tuberculin skin test, causing a temporary decrease in tuberculin skin sensitivity (AAP, 2021b; McClean et al, 2013).

Administration of the MMR and varicella vaccines is compatible if done on the same day, with different needles and at separate sites. If the two live vaccines are not given at the same time, an interval of 1 month between MMR and varicella vaccine is indicated. MMRV (ProQuad) is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in children 12 months to 12 years of age, although for the first dose, separate MMR and varicella vaccines are recommended due to increased risk of febrile seizures with MMRV (CDC, 2013a). MMR may be administered with LAIV (FluMist Quadrivalent) vaccine on the same day (Grohskopf et al, 2022). Administration of two live vaccines should be separated by 4 weeks if not given the same day.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing 

MMR is routinely given SC at 12 to 15 months of age with a repeat dose at age 4 to 6 years (McClean et al, 2013). The second dose of MMR may be given as soon as 4 weeks after the first dose, which is indicated during an epidemic or before international travel. The CDC recommends the second dose be administered as MMRV (McClean et al, 2013). Those children who have not received their second dose of MMR by age 12 should have it at that time. Adults born in 1957 or later who are at least age 18 (including those born outside the United States) should receive at least one dose of MMR if there is no serological proof of immunity or documentation of a dose given on or after the patient's first birthday. Health-care workers and other adults in high-risk groups such as students entering college, military recruits, and international travelers should receive a total of two doses of MMR. Adults born before 1957 are considered immune, but proof of immunity may be desirable for health-care workers. Infants traveling internationally between 6 and 11 months of age should receive one dose of MMR at least 2 weeks before travel; children 12 months or older should have two doses of MMR administered at least 28 days apart before international travel (AAP, 2021b). See Figure 16-1 for further information on routine dosing. The catch-up schedule for dosing children who are behind in the routine vaccine schedule is found in Figure 16-2.

In 2018, in response to record numbers of mumps cases in the United States among mostly vaccinated persons ( $70 \%$ had received two doses of MMR), the ACIP issued a recommendation that during an outbreak, persons previously vaccinated with two doses of mumps-containing vaccine receive a third dose of MMR if they are identified as being at risk from mumps exposure (Marin et al, 2018).

#### Monitoring 

Laboratory monitoring is not necessary after MMR administration if the patient received two ageappropriate doses of MMR. Rubella titer may be drawn to determine whether a patient is immune. Healthcare providers born after 1957 who cannot provide documented evidence of two doses of MMR require serological testing to determine immunity (AAP, 2021b).

#### Patient Education

All patients or the parents or guardians of the patients are required by law to receive Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) that are developed by the CDC. They are available in a variety of languages, and every effort to provide adequate information to the patient or parent before immunization should be made. These statements are available at the CDC website or at www.immunize.org in multiple languages (Table 16-1).

The SC injection of MMR may sting the patient, who may have postinjection discomfort. The VIS states that $5 \%$ to $15 \%$ of patients may experience a fever of up to $103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(39.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ approximately 7 to 12 days after administration of MMR. The patient may also experience rash, malaise, or sore throat.

## MEASLES, MUMPS, RUBELLA, AND VARICELLA VACCINE 

### Pharmacodynamics

Similar to MMR, the MMRV (ProQuad) vaccine is a live, attenuated virus vaccine that produces a subclinical infection, creating active immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses.

### Pharmacokinetics

The MMRV vaccine is administered SC. After SC injection of the first dose, the response rate at 6 weeks for patients is $91.2 \%$ for varicella, $97.4 \%$ for measles, $98.8 \%$ for mumps, and $98.5 \%$ for rubella (Merck \& Co., 2019). More than $99 \%$ of people who receive two doses of MMRV separated by at least 3 months develop evidence of immunity to all four covered viruses; for that reason, the current recommendation is for two doses.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

####Precautions and Contraindications
The contraindications for MMRV are the same as for MMR, including a history of anaphylactic reaction to neomycin or gelatin or any other component of the vaccine. Immediate treatment for anaphylaxis reaction should be available when administering MMRV.

MMRV is contraindicated in patients with primary or acquired immunodeficiency, including patients with immunosuppression associated with HIV/AIDS and patients with blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system. Immunosuppressive therapy, including high-dose steroids, may result in a more extensive vaccine-associated rash or disseminated disease. Low-dose, replacement, or short-burst therapy for asthma is not a contraindication for MMRV administration.

MMRV (ProQuad) should not be administered to a pregnant patient. The manufacturer recommends pregnancy should be avoided for at least 3 months after vaccination (Merck \& Co., 2019). Merck Sharp \& Dohme maintains a registry to monitor fetal outcomes if a woman is administered ProQuad during pregnancy. Inadvertent exposure during pregnancy should be reported to Merck \& Co., Inc., at 1-877-8888-4531 or VAERS at 1-800-822-7567, or https://vaers.bba.gov.

If a patient has untreated TB or a febrile illness with temperature greater than $101.3^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ $\left(38.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, then vaccination with MMRV should be deferred until the patient is well. Because of the increased risk of fever and febrile seizures with MMRV, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of cerebral injury, seizures, or other conditions in which physiological stress due to fever should be avoided.

No data are available on the development of thrombocytopenia in patients vaccinated with MMRV (ProQuad). Because of the known risk for thrombocytopenia with MMR, use caution when administering MMRV.

Vaccination with MMRV should be avoided for 3 months after a blood transfusion or immunoglobulin administration.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions
The adverse drug reactions seen in MMRV are similar to those for MMR, except patients are more likely to develop fever and rash. There is a risk for developing a fever 7 to 12 days after MMR administration. In prelicensure studies, MMRV fever (equal to or greater than $102^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$; equal to or greater than $39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) was seen in $21.5 \%$ of patients, compared with $14.9 \%$ of patients receiving MMR (CDC, 2013a). Postlicensure studies of febrile seizures postMMRV vaccination indicate one additional febrile seizure occurred 5 to 12 days after vaccination per 2,300 to 2,600 children aged 12 to 23 months who had received the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with children who had received the first dose of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine administered as separate injections at the same visit (CDC, 2013a). This increased risk of febrile seizure is not seen after the second dose of MMRV administered at the 4- to 6-year visit.

There is a slightly increased risk of developing a measles-like rash from $2.1 \%$ with MMR alone to $3 \%$ with MMRV. Additional adverse reactions include pain at injection site ( $22 \%$ ), erythema ( $14.4 \%$ ), and swelling ( $8.4 \%$ ), similar to what is seen in patients receiving MMR (Merck \& Co., 2019).

#### Drug Interactions
Drug interactions with MMRV are the same as for MMR: immunosuppressants, IG, tuberculin skin tests, and salicylates.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing
MMRV is given SC at 12 to 15 months of age. The first dose may be given any time before age 12 years. Use of MMRV for the repeat dose at 4 to 6 years is well tolerated. Three months should elapse before a second dose of MMRV is administered. MMRV may be administered 1 month after a dose of MMR.

#### Patient Education
The CDC recommends providers administering MMRV to children have a conversation with parents regarding the increased risk of fever and febrile seizures with the combination vaccine (CDC, 2013a). Parents should be informed about the increased risk of febrile seizures 5 to 12 days after receiving the first dose of MMRV combination but no increased risk for seizures after the second dose of MMRV (Schäfer et al, 2022). This risk will need to be weighed against the discomfort of two injections.

## ORAL POLIOVIRUS VACCINE

Although oral polio vaccine (OPV) is no longer used in the United States, it is still used in other countries because of administrative ease and low cost. In 2016, all OPV-using countries simultaneously switched from a trivalent OPV (types 1, 2, and 3) to a trivalent OPV vaccine (types 1 and 3) after type 2 polio was declared eradicated in September 2015 (Marin et al, 2017). Wild poliovirus type 1 remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan (Rachlin et al, 2022).

### Pharmacodynamics

OPV stimulates the immune system to produce antipoliovirus antibodies against Sabin poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3. After oral administration, the live, attenuated virus enters the small intestine, where it replicates in the villous epithelial cells. These specialized epithelial cells transport the viral antigens to the B cells and macrophages, which process and produce antipoliovirus antibodies. In 1 to 2 weeks after a dose of OPV, antibodies are present. The live, attenuated poliovirus fingers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract for 4 to 6 weeks, inducing both mucosal and serum antipoliovirus antibodies. The local secretory (intestinal) immune responses to OPV are greater than those induced by IPI. OPV induces intestinal immunity against wild strains of poliovirus; IPI does not. At least two doses of OPV are necessary for intestinal immunity. OPV may induce a herd-type of immunity because of the spread of live, attenuated viruses to susceptible contacts during the viral shedding period of 4 to 6 weeks after dosing. Three doses of OPV result in sustained, lifelong immunity.

### Pharmacokinetics 

After oral administration of OPV, antibody stimulation occurs within 7 to 10 days. Poliovirus antibodies have been found in serum, nasal secretions, saliva, duodenal fluids, urine, and feces. Poliovirus antibodies are distributed into breast milk.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

An anaphylactic reaction to any previous dose of OPV is a contraindication to its use. Patients with neomycin or streptomycin hypersensitivity also should not receive OPV because these agents are contained in OPV in small quantities.

OPV should be delayed if a patient has a moderate or severe febrile illness or severe respiratory infection. Administration of OPV with current viral GI infection, ongoing diarrhea, or vomiting is contraindicated. Vomiting may prevent the vaccine from reaching the stomach and small intestine. Diarrhea may increase transit time, preventing proper contact of the vaccine viruses with villous intestinal cells, and lead to decreased immune response. Vaccine administration should be delayed until the vomiting and diarrhea have been resolved.

There is a risk that immunocompromised individuals may develop poliomyelitis from use of five poliovirus, which is in OPV. Cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, radiation therapy, and immunodeficiency, including HIV or AIDS, are contraindications to OPV use. Drugs that affect the immune system, including high-dose steroids, are also a contraindication to OPV use. There is a chance that immunocompromised individuals may contract OPV-associated poliomyelitis from coming in contact with a patient who is shedding the virus. IPV is the drug of choice in immunocompromised patients. IPV should also be used if household members are immunocompromised.

Vaccination of pregnant women with OPV should be avoided. If exposure to poliomyelitis is imminent and immediate protection is needed, vaccinate with IPV according to the adult dosing schedule. OPV is safe during breastfeeding and is routinely given during infancy.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

The administration of OPV is associated with a low incidence (1 case/2.6 million doses) of paralytic poliomyelitis in patients who receive the vaccine and in household contacts. Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) is most likely to occur after the first dose of OPV. Household contacts are put at risk of developing VAPP because poliovirus is shed in the feces for 6 to 8 weeks after a dose of OPV. There is no risk of VAPP with the use of IPV, which is why, as of January 2000, IPV is the drug of choice for routine childhood immunization against polio in the United States.

#### Drug Interactions

OPV should not be administered to patients receiving immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids, interferon, and antineoplastic drugs, because there may be insufficient response to immunization. Patients may remain susceptible despite immunization. IPV is the recommended drug to use in these patients.

The CDC recommends that administration of five virus vaccines be separated by intervals of at least 1 month, unless data are available regarding simultaneous vaccination (MMR, MMRV, hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), DTP, DTaP, influenza, and H18 may be given with OPV). Concurrent administration of OPV and cholera vaccine, parenteral typhoid vaccine, or plague vaccine should generally be avoided because of increased adverse effects. Concurrent administration of five oral typhoid vaccine may result in decreased immune responses to OPV. IG may be given with OPV.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

To eliminate the risk of VAPP, the CDC recommended in January 2000 an all-IPV schedule for childhood immunizations.

For children who receive bivalent OPV outside the United States, the ACIP recommends that only documentation of IPV or trivalent OPV (tOPV) are acceptable proof of immunization (Marin et al, 2017). Persons vaccinated with monovalent OPV (mOPV) during an outbreak or bivalent OPV (bOPV) need to be reimmunized with IPV according to the U.S. IPV schedule (Marin et al, 2017).

#### Patient Education

Every effort should be made to provide adequate information to patients and parents before immunization. If a patient receives OPV, the patient and caregivers should be instructed that virus is shed in the stools for 6 to 8 weeks and that good hand washing is crucial to preventing the small chance of contracting VAPP from the infected feces. As previously mentioned, VAPP should be discussed with the parent or, if applicable, the patient before administering OPV.

## ROTAVIRUS VACCINE

### Pharmacodynamics

Rotavirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. Before widespread vaccination, almost every child in the United States would become infected with rotavirus by age 5 years, causing 400,000 doctor visits, and 55,000 to 70,000 hospital admissions (Borke et al, 2021; Cortese \& Patsahar, 2009). Rotavirus is a live oral vaccine that contains five strains of rotavirus (G1, G2, G3 or G4, P7). Rotarix is indicated for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1, G3, G4, and G9. Both vaccines are live vaccines that replicate in the small intestine and induce active immunity against rotavirus.

### Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic information regarding rotavirus vaccine is not well defined.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

Because rotavirus vaccine is a live virus vaccine, it should not be administered to infants who are or may be potentially immunocompromised, including infants with blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas, or other malignant neoplasms; infants on immunosuppressive therapy; infants with primary and acquired immunodeficiency states, including HIV/AIDS; and infants who have received blood transfusions or blood products in the past 42 days.

Infants who have a febrile illness should have the vaccine delayed, except when withholding the vaccine creates greater risk to the patient. A minor upper respiratory infection with low-grade fever (less than 100.7 ${ }^{\circ}$ ) is not a reason for withholding rotavirus vaccine. The virus should not be administered to infants with acute gastroenteritis until it improves.

Rotavirus may be shed in the stools of patients receiving the vaccine ( $8.9 \%$ of patients in clinical trials); therefore, it is prudent to use caution if the infant will have close contact with persons with malignancies or who are otherwise immunocompromised and contacts who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

A history of intussusception is a contraindication for the rotavirus vaccine because there may be an increased risk of intussusception after the first dose of rotavirus vaccine (CDC, 2011a).

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

A previous live rhesus rotavirus-based vaccine (RotaShield) was withdrawn from the market after it was found to be associated with intussusception. The risk for intussusception was evaluated in a large preclinical trials of more than 70,000 infants, which found no association with intussusception and administration of RotaTeq or Rotarix (Cortese & Parashar, 2009). Postmarketing studies found a slight increased risk (1.5 cases per 100,000 vaccinated infants) of developing intussusception in the 31 days after administration of the first dose of rotavirus vaccine, with highest risk in the first 7 days after vaccine dose (Yih et al, 2014).

GI symptoms are the major reported adverse effects in the clinical trials of RotaTeq. There was a slight increased incidence of vomiting in the RotaTeq patients (6.7% versus 5.4% for placebo after dose one, 5.0% versus 4.4% for placebo after dose two, and 3.6% versus 3.2% for placebo after dose three), as well as a slight increase in reports of diarrhea in the RotaTeq group (10.4% versus 9.1% in placebo after dose one, 8.6% versus 6.4% in placebo group after dose two, and 6.1% versus 5.4% in placebo after dose three). Symptoms of irritability did not differ between RotaTeq and placebo infants in all three doses.

Rotarix clinical trials found no increase in fever, diarrhea, or fussiness in patients who received Rotarix over placebo. Patients who received Rotarix had a slightly increased (13% versus 11%) incidence of vomiting in the week after administration.

#### Drug Interactions

During clinical trials, RotaTeq and Rotarix were routinely administered concurrently with DTaP, IPV, HIB, HBV, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. There was no evidence of reduced antibody response to these vaccines when administered with RotaTeq or Rotarix (Cortese & Parashar, 2009).

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

RotaTeq vaccination consists of a series of three ready-to-use oral liquid doses. The vaccine is administered orally beginning at 6 to 12 weeks of age with the second and third doses delivered in 4- to 10-week intervals. All doses of the vaccine should be delivered by age 32 weeks. RotaTeq was administered to preterm infants (25- to 36-weeks' gestation) according to their age in weeks, and there was no difference in adverse effects between the vaccine and the placebo. There are insufficient data on safety and efficacy outside of these age ranges.

Rotarix is a two-dose schedule of 1 mL per dose given at 2 to 4 months of age. The two doses may be administered between 6 and 24 weeks of age. The two doses should be administered at least 4 weeks apart.

The CDC has recommendations for both rotavirus vaccines, including the maximum age for the first dose, which is 14 weeks 6 days (Cortese & Parashar, 2009). If a child is inadvertently given the first dose after 15 weeks and 0 days, then the series should be continued and completed by 8 months 0 days (Cortese & Parashar, 2009). Rotavirus vaccine may be administered before, after, or concurrently with any blood product or antibody-containing product (IG). Ideally, the series should all be the same rotavirus product, but if it is unknown whether the patient received RotaTeq or Rotarix, then the series should be completed with the product available to the clinic (Cortese & Parashar, 2009). If the patient regurgitates, spits out, or vomits the rotavirus vaccine, it should not be readministered. Children who have had rotavirus gastroenteritis before completing the series should start or complete the series according to the standard schedule.

#### Patient Education

All patients or their parents or guardians are required by law to receive CDC VISs, which are available in a variety of languages. Every effort should be made to provide adequate information to patients and their parents before immunization. Because rotavirus vaccine is a live vaccine shed in the stool, caregivers should encourage strict hand-washing practices.

Parents should be instructed to report any adverse reactions to their health-care provider. Providers should fill out a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form, available at https://vaers.hhs.gov.

## **VARICELLA VIRUS VACCINE**

### Pharmacodynamics

Varicella virus vaccine (Varivax) is a live vaccine that produces an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody humoral immune response to varicella zoster virus (VZV). Vaccinated patients also have a cell-mediated immune response, with activation of both CD41 helper T cells and CD81 T lymphocytes. Efficacy of varicella vaccine is measured by protection against disease and by protection against severe disease. The efficacy of one dose of varicella vaccine is 94.4% over a 10-year period, with protection against household exposure of 90.2% (CDC, 2007). The two-dose regimen is 98.3% effective against any disease and 96.4% effective against household exposure (CDC, 2007). Vaccination appears to prevent serious disease even in patients who do not seroconvert. Postvaccination cases of varicella are mild (less than 50 lesions, frequently not vesicular, mild or no fever) and patients recover quicker than when infected with wild virus (CDC, 2007).

### Pharmacokinetics

A single SC dose of varicella virus vaccine given to children aged 12 months to 12 years stimulates IgG antibody production and results in seroconversion rates of 85.7% 6 weeks after the first dose (CDC, 2007). According to the CDC (2007), in children aged 12 months to 12 years who are administered a second dose with 3 months between doses, there is a 99.6% seroconversion response rate. When the second dose is given at age 4 to 6 years, the response is a 99.4% seroconversion rate. In patients aged 13 and older, seroconversion rates are 78% to 82%; a second dose results in 99% seroconversion in adolescents and adults. Waning immunity has not been demonstrated, with high antibody levels measured for at least 10 years after vaccination.

Postexposure prophylaxis with varicella vaccine is effective in preventing varicella disease. Administration to unvaccinated children within 3 days of exposure to varicella rash is 90% effective in preventing varicella and 70% effective if administered within 3 days of exposure (CDC, 2007). Postexposure prophylaxis is 100% effective in decreasing the severity of disease.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

Patients with neomycin or gelatin hypersensitivity should not receive varicella vaccine because there are small quantities of each in the vaccine. Varicella vaccine should be delayed if a patient has a moderate or severe illness, with or without fever.

There is a risk that immunocompromised individuals will develop varicella from use of live virus for vaccination. Cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, radiation therapy, and immunodeficiency are contraindications to varicella vaccine use. Patients with symptomatic HIV infection should not receive varicella vaccine. Regarding asymptomatic HIV-infected children, the CDC states, "HIV-infected children with CD4+ T lymphocyte percentage >15 percent and CD4 count $\geq$ 200 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ should be considered for vaccination with the single antigen varicella vaccine" (CDC, 2015).

Drugs that affect the immune system, including high-dose steroids give daily for 14 days or more, also contraindicate varicella vaccine use. Patients should not receive live vaccines for 4 weeks after high-dose corticosteroids are discontinued (AAP, 2012a). Patients who are on systemic steroids (e.g., for asthma) may be vaccinated if they are receiving less than 2 mg/kg or less than 20 mg per day of prednisone and are not otherwise immunocompromised, although some experts suggest waiting 2 weeks after discontinuation of corticosteroids before administering live vaccines (AAP, 2012a). The use of live vaccines, including varicella vaccine, in patients receiving biological responsemodifying drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies, is contraindicated. Patients should receive live vaccines 4 weeks before initiating therapy with biological response-modifying drugs (AAP, 2012a). Varicella vaccine may be given to a patient if an immunocompromised person is in the household. The patient who develops a rash after vaccination should avoid contact with the immunocompromised person for the duration of the rash, although there has been no evidence of transmission of virus to an immunocompromised person in prednisone or monitoring of more than 55 million doses (CDC, 2007).

Vaccination of pregnant women with varicella vaccine should be avoided, and pregnancy should be avoided for 1 to 3 months after vaccination. The manufacturer of Varivax has established a pregnancy registry to monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women inadvertently administered the live varicella virus vaccine 3 months before or during pregnancy. For information about the registry, call 1-800-986-6999. In 10 years of monitoring via the pregnancy registry, no cases of congenital varicella syndrome or congenital varicella birth defects have been documented (CDC, 2007). Varicella vaccine may be given if there is a pregnant household contact, such as the patient's mother. Varicella vaccine may be given to a nursing mother if the risk of exposure to natural VZV is high. It is not known if it is excreted in breast milk.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

The reactions reported most frequently in children and adults that can be attributed to varicella vaccine include fever, injection site reaction, and a vesicular rash. In healthy children, fever of 10.28 or higher is reported in $14.7 \%$ of vaccine recipients. Pain or discomfort at the injection site is reported in $24.3 \%$, with $3.4 \%$ of patients developing a vesicular rash at the injection site. A generalized vesicular rash developed in $3.8 \%$ of patients, with the median number of five or fewer lesions in healthy children. The vesicular rash occurs within 48 days of injection with varicella vaccine.

Adult and adolescent patients require two injections and have similar adverse reactions. Fever is vaccine recipients age 12 years and older was defined as a temperature of 10.0 or higher. After the first dose of varicella vaccine, $10.2 \%$ reported fever, and 9.5\% reported fever after the second dose. Localized reaction at the injection site was reported in $3 \%$ of adolescent and adult patients after the first dose and in $1 \%$ after the second dose. A generalized vesicular rash was reported by $5.5 \%$ after the first dose and $0.4 \%$ after the second dose.

#### Drug Interactions

Varicella vaccine should not be administered to patients receiving immunosuppressants, including high-dose corticosteroids, interferon, and antineoplastic drugs, because response to immunization may be insufficient. That is, patients may remain susceptible despite immunization. Patients receiving prednisone up to 20 mg per day or less than 2 mg/kg per day for less than 2 weeks may receive varicella vaccine (CDC, 2007).

Whether varicella vaccine may be inactivated by iti is unknown, although other live virus vaccines may be inactivated. Varicella vaccine should not be given for 3 to 11 months after iti is administered depending on the iti produced (CDC, 2007). The CDC recommends that iti preparations should not be administered for 2 weeks after varicella vaccine is given; the manufacturer recommends waiting 2 months. If iti is given in the interval after vaccination, the recipient should be either revaccinated if a 3 months or tested for varicella immunity 6 months later and revaccinated if indicated.

The MMR and varicella vaccines are compatible if they are administered on the same day, with different needles, and at separate sites, or in the form of MMRV. If the two live vaccines are not given at the same time, an interval of 1 month between MMR and varicella vaccine is indicated. Varicella vaccine may be given simultaneously with DTaP, DT, TH, HIS, IPV, OPV, PCV3, HPV, or HPV, using separate sites of injection.

Although no adverse effects from the use of salicylates or aspirin (ASA) have been reported, the manufacturer recommends avoidance of ASA for 6 weeks after vaccination. Keys syndrome, which affects children younger than age 15 and survey, has been associated with aspirin use after active varicella infection. Children who are on therapeutic ASA therapy may be vaccinated with the varicella vaccine, with close clinical monitoring. According to the CDC (2007), vaccination is thought to present less risk than natural varicella vaccine in these children.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing
The CDC and the AAP recommend that all healthy children who lack a reliable history of varicella infection be routinely vaccinated at age 12 to 15 months. A second dose of varicella vaccine is recommended at age 4 to 6 years (before entering kindergarten). The second dose may be administered earlier, as long as the interval between the two doses is more than 3 months. Healthy adolescents age 13 and older who have no history of varicella infection and who have not previously received varicella vaccine should be administered two doses 4 to 8 weeks apart.

Administrative error: If a child is accidentally administered zoster vaccine (Zostavax) instead of varicella vaccine (Varivax), then it should be counted as a valid vaccine and reported in the VAERS whether or not an adverse reaction occurs. The child will still require two doses of varicella vaccine. Administration of recombinant zoster vaccine (Bilogrtra) to a child is considered a vaccine administrative error and should be reported to VAERS (CDC, 2012a).

The ACIP recommends that all healthy adults be screened for varicella immunity and adults without immunity should receive varicella vaccine. Attention should be given to those adults at high risk of exposure or transmission of varicella disease. They include adults who live in households with children, live or work in an environment in which varicella transmission is likely (reachers, health-care workers, day-care workers) or could occur (college dorm, correctional institution, military), or have household contact with an immunocompromised person; nongengunit women of childbearing age; and international travelers. Performing serological testing of adults before administering is optional and may be cost-effective. The varicella vaccine dose for adults is two doses separated by 4 to 8 weeks.

#### Monitoring

There is no need to do postvaccination titers after patients receive the varicella vaccine.

#### Patient Education

All patients or their parents or guardians are required by law to receive CDC VISs, which are available in a variety of languages. Every effort should be made to provide adequate information to patients and their parents before immunization.

There may be transient homing or vinging at administration. Patients should be informed that there is a small chance that they may develop a fever, reaction at the injection site, or vesicular rash after administration of varicella vaccine.

## ZOSTER VACCINE LIVE 

Shingles is a localized, painful cutaneous eruption caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox in children. The varicella virus becomes latent in the neuronal cell bodies, and when reactivated causes shingles. The triggers for reactivation are not well understood, but it is known that cell-mediated immunity may prevent reactivation. The lifetime incidence of shingles is $1 \mathrm{to} 3$, and it affects approximately 1 million patients in the United States annually (CDC, 2008).

### Pharmacodynamics

Zoster vaccine live (Zostavax, ZVL) is a live, attenuated varicella zoster vaccine from the same strain used to develop the varicella vaccine (Varivax, ProQuad). ZVL is 70\% effective in preventing herpes zoster in persons aged 50 to 59 years, $64 \%$ effective in persons aged 60 to 69 years, and $38 \%$ effective in persons age 70 years or older (Dooling et al, 2018). The vaccine also reduces severity of zoster by $65.7 \%$ in the vaccine recipients who developed postherpetic neuralgia.
There is a decrease in vaccine effectiveness that begins 1 year after ZVL is administered, and by 6 years after vaccination, the vaccine effectiveness is less than $35 \%$ (Dooling et al, 2018). Due to higher and more long-lasting efficacy, the ACIP recommends recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in adults age 50 years or older, although ZVL may be used for immunocompetent adults age 60 years or older (Dooling et al, 2018).

### PRESCRIBING PEARL

#### Administering Multiple Vaccines

Currently, a child from age 12 to 18 months should receive up to six possible injections. This can be traumatic for patient and parent. Most public health officials recommend giving all the recommended vaccines at one visit; therefore, the child who is 15 months old could be getting as many as all six injections at that visit. Using combined vaccines is best (Fedianc, Fentacal, Vaxole) to decrease the number of injections or spread the administration of the vaccines over two or three visits. If it is necessary to give all the vaccines in one visit, as in the case of upcoming international travel or a history of urovirales attendance at well-child examinations, two people can administer the vaccines simultaneously. Giving the vaccines simultaneously makes the process faster and simpler for the patient and the person administering the vaccine. The CDC guidelines for administering injections to infants are found in the FMA Book at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/prabook/index.html.

### Pharmacokinetics

A single SC $0.65-\mathrm{mL}$ dose of zoster vaccine live produces a peak in cell-mediated response to varicella zoster in 1 to 3 weeks. Patients in the 60 - to 69 -year-old age group demonstrated a better immune response to the vaccine than patients older than age 70 .

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

Zoster vaccine live should not be administered to patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to seromycin, gelatin, or any other component of the vaccine. Patients with primary immunodeficiency states should not be administered zoster vaccine. Because zoster vaccine is a live, attenuated virus, patients with leukemia, lymphoma, cancer of the bone marrow or lymphatic system, or AIDS should not be given the vaccine because they may develop disseminated disease. Patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids (greater than 20 mg /day of prednisone) for more than 2 weeks should wait at least a month after prednisone is stopped to get the zoster vaccine.
Zoster vaccine live (Zostavax) is not approved for women of childbearing age and should not be administered to pregnant women. Zoster vaccine should not be administered to patients with active TB or acute illness, or with fever.

#### Adverse Drug Interactions

The most common adverse drug reactions to zoster vaccine reported during the clinical trials were related to the injection site. Pain/tenderness (33.4\%), erythema (33.7\%), swelling ( 34.4\%), and pruritus ( 6.6 \%) have all been reported by patients receiving zoster vaccine. Headache was reported by $1.4 \%$ of patients who received the zoster vaccine versus $0.8 \%$ of patients who received a placebo.

#### Drug Interactions

Antiviral drugs (acyclovir, fenciclovir, and valacyclovir) should be stopped at least 24 hours before zoster vaccine is administered. Antivirals should not be used for at least 14 days after vaccination (CDC, 2008).

Zoster vaccine live can be administered before, after, or at the same time as blood products or antibody-containing products.

Patients who are taking high-dose corticosteroids (greater than 20 mg/d prednisone) should not be vaccinated and need to be off prednisone for a month before vaccination. Patients on short-term corticosteroids (less than 14 days) or low-dose (less than 20 mg/d) prednisone may be vaccinated with zoster virus.

Patients taking low doses of methotrexate (less than or equal to $0.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{wk}$ ), azathioprine (less than or equal to $3.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), or 6-mercaptopurine (less than or equal to $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, polymyositis, sarcoidosis, or inflammatory bowel disease may be vaccinated with zoster vaccine (CDC, 2008).

#### Clinical Use and Death

Two doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingris) are recommended by the ACIP, rather than zoster vaccine live (Zostavax) for all adults age 50 years or older. If recombinant zoster vaccine is contraindicated or unavailable, then zoster vaccine live may be used. The zoster vaccine may be administered to adults age 50 years or older who request the vaccine or who are at risk of poor outcomes if they contract herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia (CDC, 2011b). The dose is 0.65 mL administered in the SC tissue of the deltoid region. The vaccine is given even if a patient has a history of herpes zoster (CDC, 2008). It is not necessary to screen for history of varicella disease or vaccine, nor is it necessary to test for varicella immunity before immunization. Zoster vaccine may be administered with other common vaccines in this age group: 7d, Tibp, and pneumococcal. Administration of zoster vaccine and other live virus vaccines should be separated by 4 weeks. Zoster vaccine is not recommended for patients who have received the varicella vaccine, although patients in the approved age range have most likely had wild varicella infection.

Patients with chronic medical conditions (e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pulmonary disease) may be vaccinated, but the ACIP recommends RZV for those patients (Dooling et al, 2018). Zoster vaccine should be deferred in patients with severe illness or fever. It may be administered if the patient has a minor acute illness without fever (i.e., an upper respiratory infection).

Patients who are immunocompressed have greater morbidity and mortality from herpes zoster. If patients will be initiating immunosuppressive therapy or have diseases that might lead to immunodeficiency, zoster vaccine should be administered as soon as possible while their immunity is still intact. Zoster vaccine should be administered at least 14 days before immunosuppression therapy is started. Zoster vaccine should be avoided for at least 24 months after stem-cell transplant (CDC, 2008).

Administration error: If a child is accidentally administered zoster vaccine (Zostavax) instead of varicella vaccine (Varivax), then it should be counted as a valid vaccine and reported to the 10000 whether or not an adverse reaction occurs. If an adult older than age 60 is administered the varicella vaccine (Varivax), it is not considered a valid dose and the patient is administered zoster vaccine (Zostavax) the same day (CDC, 2008). If the zoster vaccine is not administered the same day, then a dose of zoster vaccine should be administered at least 28 days later.

#### Monitoring
There is no specific monitoring of patients after receiving the zoster vaccine.
#### Patient Education
All patients who receive vaccines are required by law to receive a VIS in the appropriate language. Patients should be informed they may have discomfort at the injection site, including pain, swelling, erythema, and pruritus. See Figure 16-3.

## ORAL TYPHOID VACCINE 

### Pharmacodynamics

Typhoid vaccines are used to increase resistance to enteric fever caused by Salmonella typhi. Typhoid fever is spread by ingesting water contaminated by feces from infected persons. Worldwide, an estimated 26 million cases of typhoid fever occur annually (Appiah et al, 2022). The risk is greatest in travelers to Southern Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), although the disease can be seen in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean (Appiah et al, 2022). Oral typhoid vaccine (Vivotif Berna) is a live, attenuated vaccine, Ty21a. The oral vaccine is ingested and works in the small intestine to synthesize a lipopolysaccharide that evokes a protective immune response. The vaccine is estimated to be $50 \%$ to $80 \%$ effective in preventing typhoid fever (Jackson et al, 2015). The efficacy of protective immunity depends on the size of the bacterial inoculum consumed.

### Pharmacokinetics

The absorption, distribution, and metabolism of oral typhoid vaccine are unknown.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to typhoid vaccine is a contraindication to its use. Because oral typhoid vaccine is a live, attenuated virus, it should not be administered to immunocompromised patients, including those who are HIV-infected. Do not administer it to a patient with acute febrile illness or an acute GI illness (diarrhea).

It is not known if the vaccine is harmful to the fetus in pregnant women. If it is necessary to vaccinate a pregnant patient, inactivated typhoid vaccine is recommended.

Oral typhoid vaccine is not recommended for use in children younger than age 6 years. Use inactivated vaccine in young children.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

Adverse effects of oral typhoid vaccine are infrequent and transient and resolve with intervention. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, headache, and rash have been reported.

#### Drug Interactions

The antimalarial drug mefloquine (Lariam) can inhibit the growth of the live Ty21a strain in vitro. It is recommended that oral typhoid vaccine be given either 24 hours before or 24 hours after mefloquine. Immunosuppressants may cause insufficient response to the vaccine.

The manufacturer recommends that oral typhoid vaccine not be administered to individuals receiving sulfonamides and antibiotics, which may be active against the vaccine strains and prevent a sufficient degree of multiplication to induce a protective immune response.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing
Oral typhoid vaccine is used for primary immunization against S. typhi infection in the following:

1. Travelers to areas where a risk of exposure to S. typhi is recognized
2. People who have household contact with a documented typhoid fever carrier
3. Laboratory workers who have frequent contact with S. typhi

For primary immunization of patients older than age 6 years, the dose is one capsule on alternate days (every 48 hours; days 1, 3, 5, 7) for a total of four doses (Jackson et al, 2015). The capsule needs to be taken 1 hour before meals with a glass of cold water (not warmer than body temperature). The vaccine capsule should be swallowed whole. Ideally, the patient should finish the four doses at least 1 week before exposure or travel. A booster dose of four capsules, given every other day, is recommended every 5 years under conditions of repeated exposure (Jackson et al, 2015).

#### Monitoring

There is no specific monitoring of patients after receiving oral typhoid vaccine.

#### Patient Education

The oral typhoid vaccine should be taken exactly as prescribed. It must be taken on an empty stomach with cold water. Every-other-day dosing should be explained. The patient must understand that all four doses must be taken at least 1 week before travel to provide the best protection.

Although the possible adverse effects of the vaccine are mild and usually transient, the patient should be informed about them. The best protection against typhoid fever is food and water precautions to prevent contracting S. typhi.

## YELLOW FEVER VACCINE 

### Pharmacodynamics

Yellow fever is a viral illness spread by some species of mosquitoes in Central and South America and in tropical regions of Africa. Yellow fever is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America (Gershman \& Staples, 2021). The CDC estimates the risk of an unvaccinated traveler contracting yellow fever during a 2-week visit to West Africa as 10 cases per 100,000 and in travelers to South America 1 case per 100,000. Yellow fever produces a hemorrhagic fever and is fatal in $30 \%$ to $60 \%$ of severe cases (Gershman \& Staples, 2021). All travelers should use personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites to prevent yellow fever transmission.

Vaccination is recommended for travel to endemic areas. Endemic regions may change; therefore, travelers and health-care providers should refer to the current CDC Yellow Book (www.cdc.gov/travel) to determine the need for vaccination. Certification of yellow fever vaccine may be required for all persons aged 9 months or older to enter certain countries in endemic areas. Yellow fever vaccine (YF-Vax) is a live, attenuated virus that is prepared by culturing the 17 D strain virus in a living chick embryo.

### Pharmacokinetics

After SC administration of the vaccine, active immunity to yellow fever occurs in 7 to 10 days and lasts for 10 years or more. Before 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended proof of vaccination and revaccination every 10 years. As of 2016, one lifetime vaccine is all that is required (Gershman \& Staples, 2021).

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications

Yellow fever vaccine should be avoided in any patient with a history of egg hypersensitivity or sensitivity to chicken protein or gelatin (Gershman \& Staples, 2021). Because yellow fever vaccine is a live, attenuated virus, it is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients, including those who are HIV-infected with a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of less than $15 \%$, patients with primary immunodeficiencies, malignant neoplasms, transplant patients, or other patients on immunosuppressive therapies (Gershman \& Staples, 2021). The vaccine should be used with caution in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts of $15 \%$ to $24 \%$. Yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated in patients with a thymus disorder that affects immune function. Defer vaccination with yellow fever vaccine for 8 weeks after blood or plasma transfusion.

It is not known if the yellow fever vaccine is harmful to the fetus. Vaccinate only those pregnant women who are at high risk of contracting the disease. Use with caution in breastfeeding women.

Yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated in infants younger than 6 months due to increased risk for vaccine-associated neurological disease (Gershman \& Staples, 2021). Use with caution in infants aged 6 to 8 months. Rare cases of encephalitis have occurred in infants of this age who have received yellow fever vaccine. The ACD ${ }^{8}$ recommends postponing or avoiding travel to endemic areas for children aged 6 to 8 months.

Yellow fever vaccine should be used with caution in patients who are age 60 years or older. VAERS reports indicate an increase in serious adverse events after vaccination of patients in this age group. If patients are traveling to endemic areas, vaccination risks need to be weighed against the risk of exposure to the yellow fever virus.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

Reactions to the yellow fever vaccine are usually mild, with $10 \%$ to $30 \%$ of patients experiencing fever, headache, or malaise, which may last for 5 to 10 days after administration of the vaccine (Gershman \& Staples, 2021). Anaphylaxis may occur (1.3 cases per 100,000 doses), and epinephrine should be on hand when administering the vaccine.

A rare reaction is yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease, with symptoms of fever and multiple organ failure (Gershman \& Staples, 2021). The rate is higher among persons age 60 years or older, 1 per 100,000 in 60- to 69-year-olds and 2.3 per 100,000 in persons age 70 or older (Gershman \& Staples, 2021). The case-fatality rate for yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease is $53 \%$. The onset of illness is an average of 4 days after vaccination.

Yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease is a conglomerate of clinical syndromes, including meningoencephalitis, GBS, encephalomyelitis, bulbar palsy, and Bell's palsy. Adverse neurological outcomes are usually seen among infants as encephalitis but may occur at any age.

#### Drug Interactions

Concurrent vaccination with yellow fever vaccine and hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) and hepatitis B vaccine (HBV); meningococcal vaccine (Menomune); typhoid fever vaccine (Typhim VI); diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP, Tdap) does not appear to affect response to yellow fever vaccine. Limited data indicate there may be decreased immune response to yellow fever vaccine when given with MMR vaccine, so these vaccines should be administered 30 days apart (Gershman \& Staples, 2021).

Immunosuppressants may cause insufficient response to the yellow fever vaccine. Yellow fever vaccine should be reconstituted with the diluent supplied with the vaccine. Preservatives in diluent of other vaccines may kill the live virus in the yellow fever vaccine.

Clinical Use and Dosage
Immunization against yellow fever is recommended for all people older than age 9 months who are living in or traveling to endemic areas. Vaccination is required by international regulations for travel to certain countries. The dose is a single 0.5 -mL dose given SC (Gershman \& Staples, 2021).

#### Monitoring

There is no specific monitoring of patients needed after receiving yellow fever vaccine other than for the rare adverse drug reactions listed previously.

#### Patient Education

Patients should be educated about the mild transient adverse effects that can occur from vaccine administration. Patients should be instructed about protecting themselves against mosquitoes. Insect repellent and proper protective clothing and netting provide the best defense against insect-borne diseases.

## INACTIVATED VACCINES

The following section covers inactivated (killed) vaccines. These vaccines contain pathogens that have been inactivated or killed, making them unable to cause disease but still capable of stimulating an immune response. They typically require multiple doses and may need boosters to maintain immunity.

Key characteristics of inactivated vaccines:
- Cannot cause disease (safer for immunocompromised patients)
- Often require adjuvants to enhance immune response
- Generally more stable than live vaccines
- May require booster doses for long-term protection

## PLAGUE VACCINE

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plague vaccine (a whole-cell vaccine with inactivated *Yersinia pestis*) is **no longer available in the United States**.

Vaccination against plague is not required by any country as a condition for entry. Travelers at risk of exposure to plague (e.g., those working with potentially infected animals or in areas with active outbreaks) should:
- Be educated on plague transmission and symptoms.
- Practice strict flea avoidance measures.
- Carry prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for children <8 years) and understand when and how to use them according to CDC guidelines.
- Seek immediate medical attention if plague is suspected.

For current CDC guidelines on plague, refer to the CDC Traveler's Health website (www.cdc.gov/travel).

## RABIES VACCINE

Prevents rabies, a fatal viral disease transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, typically via bites or scratches.

### Pharmacodynamics
- **Vaccine Types**:
  - **Imovax®**: Inactivated rabies virus grown in human diploid cell (HDC) culture.
  - **RabAvert®**: Inactivated rabies virus grown in purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) culture.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Induces an active immune response, stimulating the production of neutralizing antibodies against the rabies virus.
- **Efficacy**:
  - Highly effective when administered appropriately, both for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

### Pharmacokinetics
- **Administration**:
  - Intramuscular (IM) injection, typically in the deltoid area (or anterolateral thigh in infants/young children).
- **Onset of Immunity**:
  - Protective antibody levels (≥0.5 IU/mL) are generally achieved within 7 to 14 days after initiating a primary series.
- **Duration of Immunity**:
  - After a complete primary series, immunity can persist for at least 2 years. Booster doses are recommended based on risk of exposure and antibody titers.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications
- **Absolute Contraindications**:
  - Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of rabies vaccine or any of its components (e.g., neomycin, which is present in trace amounts in some formulations).
- **Precautions**:
  - Moderate to severe acute illness (vaccination should generally be deferred until recovery for PrEP; for PEP, the benefits usually outweigh risks, but consult with public health officials).
  - Immunocompromised individuals may have a suboptimal immune response.
- **Special Populations**:
  - **Pregnancy**: **Not a contraindication** for PEP. For PrEP, vaccination should be considered if the risk of exposure is substantial. Discuss risks/benefits.
  - **Children**: Safe and effective. Dosing is the same as for adults.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions
- **Local Reactions (Common, 30-74%)**:
  - Pain, redness, swelling, itching, or induration at the injection site.
- **Systemic Reactions (Common, 5-40%)**:
  - Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, dizziness, low-grade fever.
- **Immune Complex-like Reactions (Uncommon, ~6% with boosters of HDCV - Imovax®)**:
  - Generalized urticaria, arthralgia, arthritis, angioedema, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise. Typically occur 2-21 days after a booster dose.
- **Serious (Rare)**:
  - Anaphylaxis.
  - Neurological events (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis, transverse myelitis) have been reported very rarely; a causal link is not always clear.

> [!WARNING]
> **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is a Medical Urgency**
> For individuals potentially exposed to rabies, PEP should be initiated as soon as possible. Delays can be fatal. Pregnancy is NOT a contraindication to PEP.

#### Drug Interactions
- **Chloroquine and related antimalarials**: May interfere with the antibody response to intradermal (ID) rabies vaccine (not a recommended route in the US for PrEP). If possible, complete PrEP before starting chloroquine. IM route is preferred.
- **Immunosuppressants**: Corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive drugs, or radiation therapy may reduce the immune response to rabies vaccine. If possible, PrEP should be administered before or after such treatments. For PEP in immunosuppressed individuals, serological testing post-vaccination is crucial.
- **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)**:
  - HRIG (Human Rabies Immunoglobulin) provides passive immunity and can partially suppress the active immune response to the vaccine. **Do NOT exceed the recommended dose of RIG.** Administer RIG at a different anatomical site from the vaccine.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

**1. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)**
- **Indications**: Individuals at high risk of rabies exposure:
  - Veterinarians, veterinary staff, animal control officers, wildlife handlers.
  - Rabies laboratory workers.
  - Travelers spending extended time in areas with enzootic rabies and limited access to PEP.
- **Schedule (Imovax® or RabAvert®)**:
  - **Primary Series**: Two 1.0 mL IM doses, administered on Day 0 and Day 7.
  - **Booster Recommendations (based on risk category and antibody titers)**:
    - **Sustained Risk (e.g., rabies researchers, vaccine production workers)**: Rabies antibody titer check every 6 months. Booster if titer <0.5 IU/mL.
    - **Frequent Risk (e.g., veterinarians, animal control in enzootic areas, bat handlers)**: Rabies antibody titer check every 2 years. Booster if titer <0.5 IU/mL. OR a one-time booster dose 3 weeks to 3 years after the primary 2-dose series, then no further routine testing or boosters.
    - **Infrequent Risk (e.g., travelers to high-risk areas)**: No routine titer checks or booster doses after the primary 2-dose series.

> [!NOTE]
> The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated PrEP recommendations in 2022 to a 2-dose series (Day 0, Day 7). Previous 3-dose PrEP schedules are still considered valid.

**2. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**
- **Indications**: Any individual bitten, scratched, or exposed via mucous membranes to saliva or neural tissue of a confirmed or suspected rabid animal.
- **Management**: **ALWAYS** includes:
  1.  **Wound Care**: Immediate and thorough washing of the wound with soap and water for at least 15 minutes. A virucidal agent (e.g., povidone-iodine) should be applied.
  2.  **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)**: Administer on Day 0.
      - **HRIG (HyperRAB® S/D, Kedrab®)**: Dose is 20 IU/kg body weight.
      - Infiltrate as much of the dose as anatomically feasible into and around the wound(s). Administer any remaining volume IM at a site distant from vaccine administration.
      - If RIG was not given with the first vaccine dose, it can be given up to 7 days after the first vaccine dose.
  3.  **Rabies Vaccine Series**:
      - **Previously Unvaccinated Individuals**: Four 1.0 mL IM doses of rabies vaccine. One dose on Day 0, and one dose on Days 3, 7, and 14.
      - **Previously Vaccinated Individuals** (documented complete PrEP or PEP with cell-culture vaccine, or previous documented rabies antibody titer ≥0.5 IU/mL): Two 1.0 mL IM doses of rabies vaccine. One dose on Day 0 and one dose on Day 3. **RIG should NOT be given.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For PEP in immunocompromised individuals, a 5-dose vaccine schedule (Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28) plus RIG is recommended, regardless of prior vaccination status. Serologic testing post-vaccination is also advised.

#### Patient Education
- **Pre-Vaccination (PrEP or PEP)**:
  - Provide Vaccine Information Statement (VIS).
  - Explain the reason for vaccination (PrEP risk or PEP exposure).
  - Discuss the dosing schedule and importance of completing the series.
  - Inform about common adverse reactions (local site reactions, mild systemic symptoms).
  - Advise acetaminophen or NSAIDs for discomfort.

- **Post-Exposure Specifics**:
  - Emphasize the critical importance of wound care.
  - Explain the roles of both RIG (immediate passive protection) and vaccine (long-term active protection).
  - Stress adherence to the complete PEP schedule.

- **When to Seek Care**:
  - Signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat).
  - High fever, severe or persistent symptoms, or any neurological symptoms.

- **Animal Contact Avoidance (for PrEP recipients in high-risk professions)**:
  - Reinforce safe animal handling practices.

- **Documentation**:
  - Record vaccine name, lot number, administration site(s), and date(s) for all doses of vaccine and RIG.

#### Monitoring
- **PrEP**: Serologic testing for rabies antibody titers as per risk category (see PrEP Booster Recommendations).
- **PEP**: Post-vaccination serologic testing is **not** routinely recommended for immunocompetent individuals who receive PEP according to ACIP guidelines.
  - Testing may be considered for immunocompromised individuals or those whose PEP regimen deviated from recommendations.

## ISSUES IN IMMUNIZATION

This section addresses key considerations and standards related to immunization practices for various populations, adapted from common clinical guidelines and recommendations.

### Immunization in Special Populations

#### Pregnant Patients
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has published guidelines for vaccinating pregnant women (see [CDC Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp-toolkit/guidelines.html)). Key considerations include:

- The risk from vaccination during pregnancy is largely theoretical.
- The benefit of vaccination among pregnant women usually outweighs the potential risk when:
  - (a) The risk for disease exposure is high.
  - (b) Infections would pose a special risk for the mother or fetus.
  - (c) The vaccine is unlikely to cause harm.

Generally, live virus vaccines are contraindicated in pregnant women because of the possible risk of transmission to the fetus. If a woman is inadvertently given a live virus vaccine while pregnant, she should be counseled about the potential effects on the fetus. It is not normally an indication to terminate the pregnancy.

**Recommendations for Vaccination During Pregnancy Include the Following:**

| Vaccine                     | May Be Given if Indicated | Contraindicated During Pregnancy | Comments                                                                                                                               |

#### Immunocompromised Patients
For practical considerations, persons with immunocompromising conditions may be divided into three groups:

1.  **Persons who are severely immunocompromised not as a result of HIV infection** (e.g., due to congenital immunodeficiencies, high-dose corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or other immunosuppressive drugs).
    -   In general, these patients should **not** be administered live vaccines (both viral and bacterial).
    -   Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is **not** contraindicated for their close contacts.
    -   Passive immunization with immunoglobulin should be considered for immunocompromised persons instead of or in addition to vaccination for certain exposures (e.g., varicella, measles).

2.  **Persons with HIV infection**.
    -   Vaccination recommendations depend on the level of immunosuppression (CD4+ T-lymphocyte count).
    -   In general, persons known to be HIV-infected should **not** receive live virus or live bacteria vaccines if severely immunocompromised (e.g., CD4 count <200 cells/µL).
    -   MMR vaccination is recommended for all children and for adults when otherwise indicated, if not severely immunocompromised.
    -   Varicella vaccine may be considered for HIV-infected individuals who are not severely immunocompromised and lack evidence of immunity.
    -   Enhanced inactivated polio vaccine (eIPV) is the preferred polio vaccine.
    -   Pneumococcal vaccines (conjugate and polysaccharide) are indicated for all HIV-infected persons ≥2 years of age.
    -   Annual influenza vaccination (inactivated) is recommended.

3.  **Persons with conditions that cause limited immune deficits** (e.g., asplenia, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus) that may require use of special vaccines or higher doses of vaccines but that do not contraindicate use of any particular vaccine.
    -   Persons with these conditions are generally not considered severely immunosuppressed for the purposes of vaccination and should receive routine vaccinations with both live and inactivated vaccines according to the usual schedules, with specific considerations for their condition (e.g., enhanced pneumococcal, meningococcal, and *Haemophilus influenzae* type b vaccination for asplenia).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specific ACIP recommendations for each group should always be consulted, as guidelines can be complex and nuanced.

#### Travel Immunization
International travel is becoming more common, with jets allowing people to travel great distances in a few hours. With international travel comes exposure to infectious diseases not common in the United States. Patients should be advised to begin to prepare for their trip at least 4-8 weeks before departure.

To determine what vaccines the traveling patient will need, the provider can consult with a local travel clinic or the CDC. The CDC website has a comprehensive travel information section, maintained by the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) (see [CDC Travelers' Health](http://www.cdc.gov/travel/)). The website allows the provider or patient to inquire into recommendations based on the region the patient will be traveling to. Information on traveling with children, outbreaks, and special needs travelers is also located at this site.

The CDC also publishes an annual guide, *CDC Yellow Book: Health Information for International Travel*, which is an essential resource.

In addition to special immunizations required by travel, patients should also have all of the recommended routine immunizations for their age, including influenza vaccine. Patients should have a copy of their current immunizations included with their travel documents.

## Zoster Vaccine

Herpes zoster is a painful skin eruption that is a reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus, with approximately 1 million cases a year in the United States (Dooling et al., 2018). Postherpetic neuralgia can occur in 10% to 13% of herpes zoster cases in persons aged 50 years or older.

In 2017, a recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) was approved, in addition to zoster vaccine live (ZVL, Zostavax), which is approved for immunocompetent adults. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends the use of RZV over ZVL due to better efficacy against herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia (Dooling et al., 2018).

### Pharmacodynamics

Recombinant zoster vaccine boosts varicella zoster virus-specific immune response, which protects against zoster disease. The efficacy of RZV vaccine in prevention of herpes zoster is 96.6% in persons 50 to 59 years, 97.4% in persons age 60 to 69 years, and 91.3% in persons age 70 or older (Dooling et al., 2018).

### Pharmacokinetics

Exact pharmacokinetics for recombinant zoster vaccine is unknown.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications
Recombinant zoster vaccine is contraindicated in persons with a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or after a previous dose of Shingrix.

Recombinant zoster vaccine should not be administered to a person with an acute episode of herpes zoster. Vaccination should be delayed until the acute illness has resolved.

There are no data indicating whether RZV is safe in pregnant or lactating women. Pregnancy testing is not needed before administering RZV. Women known to be pregnant should delay RZV vaccination until after pregnancy. If RZV is inadvertently administered to a pregnant woman, no intervention is needed, but she should be informed about the lack of safety data.

Safety and effectiveness in children younger than age 18 years have not been determined. RZV is not indicated for primary prevention of varicella (chickenpox) infection.

### Adverse Drug Reactions

Adverse reactions to RZV include local injection site reactions such as pain, redness, and swelling. Systemic adverse effects are common and include myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms. These reactions are generally mild to moderate and resolve within 2-3 days.

There is an increased risk (approximately 3 per 1 million doses administered) of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in the 42 days after receiving the RZV vaccine, although a causal relationship has not been established.

### Drug Interactions

There are no known clinically significant drug interactions with RZV. It can be coadministered with other adult vaccines, such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, at different anatomical sites.

### Clinical Use and Dosing

Recombinant zoster vaccine is recommended as part of the routine adult schedule for all immunocompetent adults aged 50 years or older, including those who have previously received ZVL.

RZV (Shingrix) 0.5 mL is administered intramuscularly (IM) in two doses:
- First dose at elected date.
- Second dose 2 to 6 months after the first dose.

For immunodeficient or immunosuppressed persons aged 18 years or older, RZV is also recommended. The schedule is two doses of RZV:
- First dose at elected date.
- Second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose.

Ideally, a patient is vaccinated with RZV before starting immunosuppression therapy, when their immune response is likely to be strongest (Anderson et al., 2022).

> [!NOTE]
> If more than 6 months have passed since the first dose for immunocompetent individuals (or more than 2 months for immunosuppressed individuals), the second dose should be administered as soon as possible. The series does not need to be restarted.

### Monitoring

There is no ongoing laboratory monitoring required after RZV vaccine administration. Patients should be observed for immediate allergic reactions per standard vaccination practice.

### Patient Education

Patients should be informed of:
- The benefits of RZV vaccination in preventing herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.
- The recommended two-dose schedule and the importance of completing the series.
- Expected adverse effects of the vaccine, including common local injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling) and systemic reactions (myalgia, fatigue, headache, fever).
- That these reactions are usually temporary and self-limiting.
- The rare risk of GBS.
- When to contact a healthcare provider for severe or persistent adverse reactions.

## Immunoglobulin Serums

Immunoglobulin (IG) serums provide passive immunity to infectious diseases. The choice of IG is determined by the types of products available, the type of antibody desired, route of administration, timing, and other considerations. IG products that may be used in primary care include:

-   Immunoglobulin Intramuscular (IGIM): e.g., GamaSTAN S/D
-   Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG): e.g., HepaGam B, Nabi-HB
-   Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG): e.g., HyperTET S/D
-   Varicella Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG): e.g., VARIZIG
-   Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG): e.g., HyperRAB S/D, Imogam Rabies HT
-   Rho(D) Immunoglobulin: e.g., RhoGAM, HyperRHO S/D Full Dose, WinRho SDF
-   Botulism Immunoglobulin Intravenous (BIG-IV, BabyBIG)
-   Vaccinia Immunoglobulin Intravenous (VIGIV)

> [!NOTE]
> Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immunoglobulin (RSV-IGIV) is no longer available in the U.S.

### Pharmacodynamics

IGs are derived from the pooled plasma of adult human donors, processed by methods such as cold ethanol fractionation. They consist primarily of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction (≥95% IgG) and are not known to transmit hepatitis viruses, HIV, or other common infectious diseases due to viral inactivation and removal steps during manufacturing. The concentrated protein solution contains specific antibodies in proportion to the infectious and immunization experience of the donor population from which the plasma was derived.

Specific IGs (e.g., HBIG, TIG) differ from standard IGIM (sometimes referred to as gamma globulin) in that they are prepared from plasma pools selected for high titers of specific antibodies against a particular antigen.

-   **IGIM (e.g., GamaSTAN S/D)** is a sterile preparation of concentrated antibodies. IGIM provides protection against hepatitis A and measles through passive transfer of antibody. It may be used for pre-exposure prophylaxis or postexposure prevention in the treatment of hepatitis A; it is used postexposure for measles.

-   **Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG, e.g., HepaGam B)** is a sterile solution of IGs (typically 10% to 18% protein) containing high titers of antibodies against Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). HBIG is used to provide passive immunity to patients after exposure to HBsAg-positive blood or body fluids (e.g., needlestick injury, sexual exposure) and for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.

-   **Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG, e.g., HyperTET S/D)** is prepared from the plasma of adults who are hyperimmunized with tetanus toxoid. TIG contains antibodies that neutralize the exotoxin (tetanospasmin) produced by *Clostridium tetani*. The passive immunity bestowed by TIG is capable of attenuating or preventing tetanus infection by binding free exotoxin before it can bind to nerve tissue.

-   **Varicella-Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG, VARIZIG)** is derived from human plasma and consists of IgG that contains high titers of antibodies to varicella zoster virus. VZIG is used primarily for passive immunization of high-risk susceptible patients after exposure to chickenpox or herpes zoster to prevent or attenuate disease. High-risk groups include immunocompromised children and adults, pregnant women without evidence of immunity, newborns of women with varicella shortly before or after delivery, premature infants, and neonates and infants younger than 12 months without evidence of immunity.

-   **Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG, e.g., HyperRAB S/D, Imogam Rabies HT)** is primarily gamma globulin containing high titers of rabies antibodies. RIG is used to provide passive immunity to rabies in patients exposed to the virus. Rabies antibodies neutralize the rabies virus, retarding its spread and inhibiting its effectiveness, providing immediate protection until the patient's immune system responds to rabies vaccine.

-   **Rho(D) Immunoglobulin (e.g., RhoGAM)** is used to prevent isoimmunization in Rho(D)-negative women exposed or potentially exposed to Rho(D)-positive red blood cells (e.g., during delivery of an Rho(D)-positive infant, miscarriage, abortion, or transfusion of Rho(D)-positive blood). Rho(D) immunoglobulin is a solution containing IgG antibodies against the erythrocyte antigen Rho(D), collected from the plasma of human donors. It is believed that the anti-Rho(D) antibodies in Rho(D) immunoglobulin interact directly with the Rho(D) antigens on fetal red blood cells in the maternal circulation, preventing the mother's immune system from recognizing and becoming sensitized to the Rho(D) antigen. This prevents the development of erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn) in current or subsequent pregnancies.

-   **Botulism Immunoglobulin Intravenous (BIG-IV, BabyBIG)** provides immunoglobulin derived from adults immunized with botulinum toxoid types A and B, and provides antibodies against circulating botulism toxins A and B. It is used for the treatment of infant botulism.

-   **Vaccinia Immunoglobulin Intravenous (VIGIV)** provides passive immunity for certain complications of vaccinia (smallpox) vaccination, such as eczema vaccinatum, severe or progressive vaccinia, and certain other vaccinia infections in patients with underlying skin conditions.

### Pharmacokinetics

-   **IGIM**: When used for pre-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A, a standard dose confers protection for approximately 3 months; larger doses can extend protection up to 5 months. It is greater than 85% effective in preventing hepatitis A if given within 2 weeks after exposure. IGIM can be given to prevent or modify measles in susceptible persons if used within 6 days of exposure.

-   **HBIG**: Slowly absorbed after IM administration, with antibodies typically appearing in 1 to 6 days and peak levels reached in 3 to 9 days. The antibodies remain in the serum for up to 2 months. HBIG likely crosses the placenta and may be distributed in breast milk.

-   **TIG**: Given IM, with peak levels of IgG noted approximately 2 days after administration. The half-life of IgG in circulation is approximately 3.5 to 4.5 weeks (23-28 days).

-   **VZIG**: Administered IM, with peak IgG levels obtained approximately 2-5 days after administration. It is most effective if administered as soon as possible after exposure to VZV, ideally within 96 hours but may be effective up to 10 days post-exposure. Antibody protection lasts for at least 3 weeks.

-   **RIG**: Administered by infiltrating as much of the dose as feasible into and around the wound(s), with any remaining volume given IM at a site distant from vaccine administration. Provides immediate passive antibodies.

-   **Rho(D) Immunoglobulin**: Pharmacokinetics is not well described. Peak antibody levels are reached in approximately 5 to 10 days after IM administration. Anti-Rho(D) antibodies are generally not detectable 6 months after administration of a standard 300 mcg dose.

-   **BIG-IV (BabyBIG)**: Has a reported half-life of approximately 28 days in infants.

-   **VIGIV**: After IV infusion, peaks rapidly (e.g., within 2 hours) and has a reported half-life of approximately 22-30 days.

### Pharmacotherapeutics

#### Precautions and Contraindications
- An allergic response to IG serums or their components (e.g., thimerosal, if present in a specific formulation) is a contraindication to IG serum use.
- Patients with selective IgA deficiency who have developed antibodies against IgA are more likely to have anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to pooled IG products containing IgA. If IG administration is necessary, products with very low IgA content should be considered, and administration should occur in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis.
- Live-virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella) should not be administered within 3 months of an IG serum. (Note: This interval can be longer, up to 11 months, depending on the IG product and dose; consult specific ACIP recommendations or product labeling).
- Pregnancy is not a contraindication to most IG serums when clearly indicated.
- BIG-IV (BabyBIG) is not indicated for adults or children older than 12 months. Safety and efficacy are not established for children age 1 year or older.
- VIGIV is contraindicated in patients with isolated vaccinia keratitis due to the risk of increased corneal scarring.
> [!WARNING]
> VIGIV may cause falsely high blood glucose readings on some test systems due to the maltose in the preparation. Blood glucose testing should be done with a glucose-specific method (e.g., glucose oxidase, glucose hexokinase, or glucose dehydrogenase nicotine adenine dinucleotide–based tests).

### Adverse Drug Reactions
- **Local Reactions:** Tenderness, pain, erythema, and induration at the injection site are common and may last for several hours.
- **Systemic Reactions:**
    - Mild: Urticaria, angioedema, flushing, headache, myalgia, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargy.
    - Rare but Serious: Anaphylactic reactions (particularly in IgA-deficient individuals with anti-IgA antibodies).

### Drug Interactions
IG serums interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines. Live virus vaccines should generally not be administered within 3 months (and up to 11 months, depending on the specific IG product, dose, and vaccine) of an IG serum. Consult current ACIP guidelines for specific interval recommendations.

### Clinical Use and Dosing
IG serums are used to prevent disease by either pre-exposure or postexposure administration. The clinical use and dosing of the IG serums are detailed in Table 16-4.

*IM, intramuscular; IV, intravenous. Dosing and indications should always be confirmed with current package inserts and ACIP recommendations.*

### Monitoring
- Laboratory monitoring is generally not necessary for most IG serum administrations.
- The patient's Rh status and antibody screen should be determined before administering Rho(D) immunoglobulin.
- Patients who receive BIG-IV for infant botulism should be monitored for clinical response and relapse of botulism, as relapse may occur up to 1 month after administration.
- Monitor for acute adverse reactions during and after IV administration of IG products.

### Patient Education
Patients (or parents/guardians) should receive information regarding the benefits and risks of the specific IG serum before administration. Any questions or concerns regarding the vaccine should be addressed.
Key points for patient education include:
- The reason for administration.
- The source of IG products (human plasma) and safety measures.
- Expected benefits and temporary nature of passive immunity.
- Common adverse reactions (e.g., pain/erythema at injection site).
- Signs of severe reactions and when to seek medical attention.
- Potential interference with live virus vaccines.

## Diagnostic Biologicals

### Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative

The diagnostic biological agent that is commonly used in primary care is tuberculin PPD. PPD is used to screen asymptomatic individuals for infection with M. tuberculosis.

#### Pharmacodynamics

PPD is administered intradermally to asymptomatic individuals. Once a person has become sensitized to mycobacterial antigens, a hypersensitivity reaction occurs to the administration of the intradermal PPD. In sensitive people, the reaction includes induration and erythema at the site of administration. A positive reaction to PPD indicates that the person at some time has had a TB infection. A positive test does not indicate an active infection but rather that further testing is indicated. See Chapter 50 for more information regarding TB evaluation.

#### Pharmacotherapeutics

##### Precautions and Contraindications
Do not administer PPD to known tuberculin-positive reactors because they may have a severe reaction, including ulceration and necrosis at the site of administration. SC administration should be avoided, as a general febrile reaction or acute inflammation may occur.

Skin testing of immunodeficient people may not be accurate because skin-test responsiveness may be suppressed. Skin test responsiveness may be delayed in the older adult patient.

PPD testing is safe in pregnancy, during lactation, and in children of all ages, including infants.

#### Adverse Drug Reactions

In highly sensitive people, vesiculation, ulceration, and necrosis can occur at the administration site. A normal adverse reaction is a minimal amount of bleeding at the administration site.

#### Drug Interactions

Live-virus vaccines (MMR, varicella) can suppress the reaction to PPD if given 4 to 6 weeks before the PPD. PPD can be administered at the time that MMR and varicella vaccines are administered. Patients who have been vaccinated with BCG generally are sensitive to PPD. Immunosuppressant medications can suppress the reaction to PPD testing.

#### Clinical Use and Dosing

The Mantoux PPD test containing 5 tuberculin units (TU) is the preferred test because the interpretation of the reaction has been standardized. Previously, multiple puncture tests were used, and there were many problems with interpretation. The test consists of injecting 5 TU of PPD intradermally. A small white bleb should appear at the injection site if it is done correctly. Reactions are read in 48 to 72 hours after administration. For patients who may be highly sensitized, a test dose of 1 TU is used.

The CDC recommends two-step testing of all health care personnel upon hire, because some people with latent TB have a negative reaction when tested years after initial infection. The first test may boost a reaction to the second test (CDC, 2019). The steps for the two-step testing are as follows:

Step 1

1.  Administer the first PPT skin test.
2.  If positive, the person is considered infected and needs to be evaluated for TB disease.
3.  If negative, the person needs a second TB skin test 1 to 3 weeks after the first skin test.

Step 2

1.  Administer the second PPD skin test.
2.  If positive, the person is considered infected and needs to be evaluated for TB disease.
3.  If negative, the person is not infected.

Determining the results of the skin test is based on the likelihood of infection and the risk of active TB if infection has occurred. If the patient is HIV-positive or has fibrotic lesions on chest x-ray, a reaction of 5 mm or more induration is considered positive. A reaction of 10 mm or more induration is considered positive in other at-risk patients, including infants and children. In patients who are not in any highrisk category or high-risk environment, a result of 15 mm or more induration is considered positive.

Patients are considered high risk if they have any of the following: (1) diabetes mellitus; (2) prolonged therapy with adrenocorticosteroids; (3) immunosuppressive therapy; (4) hematological and/or reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin's disease; (5) injection drug users known to be HIV-seronegative; (6) end-stage renal disease; or (6) any clinical presentation that includes substantial rapid weight loss or chronic malnutrition.

People who are in a high-incidence group with a skin test reaction of 10 mm or more induration are candidates for preventive therapy, even if they do not have any of the risk factors. High-incidence groups include the following: (1) foreign-born persons from high-prevalence countries, (2) medically underserved low-income populations, and (3) residents of facilities for long-term care.

#### Monitoring

The PPD should be read by an experienced health-care professional who has been trained in the proper method of interpreting the results.

#### Patient Education

Patients must have an understanding of the reason for PPD testing and why the test must be read in 48 to 72 hours. Adverse reactions are rare in patients who are not already sensitized to TB.
