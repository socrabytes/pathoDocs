## Summary

Cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes since 2,000 BCE. In the 19th century, cannabis was used in India to treat tetanus and convulsive disorders and in France to treat mental disorders (Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) classified cannabis as a medical compound in 1851, with later editions including information on how to prepare dried cannabis flowers into tinctures and extracts to be used as analgesics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsants (Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Cannabis prohibition was passed in 1937 and it is currently a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (Drug Enforcement Administration, 2020). Thirty-seven states, four territories, and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing cannabis for medicinal use, with eighteen states, two territories, and the District of Columbia legalizing it for recreational use (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2022).

## Endocannabinoid System

Understanding of the therapeutic potential for cannabis progressed with identification of the cannabis receptors and their location in the human body during the 1980s and 1990s and identification of the endocannabinoid system shortly thereafter (Mechoulam et al, 2014). The endocannabinoid system consists of endocannabinoids, their receptors, and the enzymes associated with their synthesis and degradation. Cannabinoid receptors are G-protein receptors activated by endogenous endocannabinoids, cannabinoids from cannabis, and synthetic cannabinoids (Jarvis et al, 2017). Cannabinoids work on the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. The first endocannabinoid identified, anandamide, is a partial agonist for CB1 and CB2 (Mechoulam et al, 2014). Both anandamide and a second endocannabinoid, 2AG, are synthesized on demand by the body and have autoprotective effects (Mechoulam et al, 2014). CB1 receptors are located in the central nervous system, including basal ganglia (affecting motor activity), cerebellum (motor coordination), hippocampus (short-term memory), neocortex (thinking), and hypothalamus and limbic cortex (appetite, gastric motility, and sedation). CB2 receptors are found on immune cells and tissues, the spinal column, bone marrow, and the brain. These receptors are expressed during inflammatory and neurogenic conditions, leading to an interest in their therapeutic potential for pain and neurodegenerative illness (Bie et al, 2018). When stimulated, CB2 receptors are not psychoactive.

## Cannabinoids

The cannabis plant has up to 400 phytochemicals and 104 cannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabinol (CBD), terpenoids, flavonoids, and other molecules (Aggarwal & Blinderman, 2014; Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 2017). THC has psychoactive properties, whereas CBD has no psychotropic effects. Although retail settings often advertise effects specific to Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica subspecies, interbreeding and hybridization of the plant has made these distinctions "almost meaningless" (McPartland, 2018). States vary widely in cannabis labeling and packaging requirements (Kruger et al, 2021). All states with medical programs require delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol content to be listed on the label, and more than 8% require other elements such as batch number, health risks, production tracking, and cannabinoid content (Kruger et al, 2021). The merging of recreational and medical programs in many states has led to evidence that the potency of THC content is much higher for medically advertised products than is clinically warranted, which can unfortunately lead to untoward effects (Cash et al, 2020).

There are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cannabinoid products on the market (Table 9-1). EpidioloxTM is a CBD-only product that the FDA has approved for treatment of three types of seizures (FDA, 2020). Dronabinol (MarinolTM) is a synthetic cannabinoid that is a Schedule III controlled drug used for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and anorexia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Nabilone (CesametTM) is a Schedule II synthetic cannabinoid approved for nausea and vomiting in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Nabiximols (SativexTM) is a product approved in 30 countries outside the United States, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union, to treat spasticity. SativexTM is available as an oral mucosal spray containing THC and CBD in a 1:1 ratio approved for muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.

## Pharmacokinetics of Cannabis

Cannabis preparations have been developed to allow for oral, nasal-inhalation, intranasal, mucosal (sublingual and buccal), transcutaneous (transdermal), local (topical), and parental delivery in both medical and nonmedical applications (Ahmoudinoodezh et al, 2022). When cannabis is smoked and absorbed through the lungs, the onset is within minutes, reaches peak blood levels in approximately 30 minutes, and has a duration of 1 to 3-5 hours (Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Vaporized cannabis can produce greater pharmacodynamic effects and higher concentrations of THC in the blood compared with smoking (Spindle et al, 2018). When cannabis is ingested orally and absorbed in the intestine, the onset is 30 minutes to 2 hours, with a duration of 5 to 8 hours or longer. Orally ingested THC is converted in the liver via first-pass effect into 11-OH-THC and a long-acting active metabolite (Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Nabiximols oral mucosal spray reaches maximum concentration (Tmax) at 2.8 hours for the CBD component and 2.4 hours for the THC component (Karschner et al, 2011). There is minimal scientific information available about the pharmacokinetics of topical creams, salves, vaginal sprays, or rectal suppositories containing cannabinoids.

## Pharmacodynamics of Cannabis 

There are multiple active ingredients in cannabis. The most common and most studied pharmacologically active cannabinoids are THC and CBD, available in a number of preparations and formulations. Both THC and CBD are highly lipophilic and metabolized by the liver; both the route of administration and patient-specific factors, such as liver disease, may affect the pharmacodynamics of the product (Huestis, 2007). National surveys have shown that about $7 \%$ of adults report using cannabis medically, though not all have medical authorization (Azcarate et al, 2020). Those using cannabis medically most commonly report use for anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and depression (Azcarate et al, 2020). The current evidence for medical benefits and adverse effects will be covered here.

### Anorexia, Weight Loss, and Appetite Stimulation

There have been two systematic reviews examining the use of cannabinoids for appetite stimulation or prevention of wasting in patients with HIV/AIDS, both of which concluded there was insufficient evidence for the use of cannabinoids (Whiting et al, 2015). Likewise, studies on the use of cannabinoids for cancer-related anorexia, cachexia syndrome, and anorexia nervosa lack sufficient evidence for recommendation. One placebo-controlled trial of dronabinol showed a positive weight gain effect of 1 kg over 4 weeks for patients with anorexia nervosa (Rosager et al, 2021).

### Anorexia, Weight Loss, and Appetite Stimulation 

There have been two systematic reviews examining the use of cannabinoids for appetite stimulation or prevention of wasting in patients with HIV/AIDS, both of which concluded there was insufficient evidence for the use of cannabinoids (Whiting et al, 2015). Likewise, studies on the use of cannabinoids for cancer-related anorexia, cachexia syndrome, and anorexia nervosa lack sufficient evidence for recommendation. One placebo-controlled trial of dronabinol showed a positive weight gain effect of 1 kg over 4 weeks for patients with anorexia nervosa (Rosager et al, 2021).

### Anxiety

Stancieu et al (2021) noted that clinical trials of THC for anxiety have been short term and inconclusive. CBD alone has been evaluated for social anxiety disorder in both premedication dosing ( 600 mg ) and daily dosing and found to be modestly effective (Stancieu et al, 2021). The limited size and duration of trials constrain the ability to recommend both dosing and frequency of cannabis treatments.

### Chronic Pain

Chronic pain is the most common reason patients report medicinal cannabis use. Whiting et al (2015) conducted a systematic review of 28 randomized controlled trials of patients with chronic pain. In eight trials (seven with nabiximols and one with inhaled cannabis), $30 \%$ of patients reported improvement of pain versus controls (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.99-2.00; eight trials; Whiting et al, 2015). Based on the current evidence, the NAS Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana concluded there is "substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults" (p. 4-4). Another systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluated the efficacy of cannabis for both cancer and noncancer pain and found that there was a moderate to high certainty of evidence that noninhaled medical cannabis or cannabinoids results in a small to very small improvement in pain relief, physical functioning, and sleep quality among patients with chronic pain, along with several transient adverse side effects, compared with placebo (Wang et al, 2021). Although cannabis has been shown to be effective for chronic neuropathic pain in particular, relief requires use of the THC component, which may cause both psychoactive effects and dependence (Mücke et al, 2018).

### Cancer

There are many claims that cannabinoids cure cancer, including brain tumors in children. The Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana reported only one good-quality systematic review focusing on the use of cannabinoids on gliomas. Research into the effects of cannabis on cell apoptosis, proliferation, and inflammation, which may affect cancer treatment, is still in the preclinical stages (Nigro et al, 2021). Of the 2,260 studies in the Rocha et al (2014) review, only 35 preclinical studies were of adequate quality to meet the inclusion criteria, with 16 in-vivo studies showing antitumor effects of cannabinoids. The Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana determined there is insufficient evidence to support or refute that cannabinoids are an effective treatment for cancer.

### Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Nabilone and dronabinol were approved in 1985 for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in cancer chemotherapy for patients who failed to respond to conventional antiemetic treatments. There have been two systematic reviews of the use of cannabinoids for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting compared with standard antiemetics or placebo: Whiting et al (2015) and a Cochrane review (Smith et al, 2015). Whiting et al (2015) concluded that cannabinoids demonstrated greater benefit than standard antiemetics or placebo, whereas Smith et al (2015) concluded that there was not enough evidence to support the use of cannabinoids over standard therapy. There have been minimal studies and one systematic review of antiemetic therapies in children receiving chemotherapy that found no improvement of emesis over control (Phillips et al, 2016). The Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana states that there is conclusive evidence to demonstrate the oral cannabinoids are as effective as standard antiemetics for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, noting there have been no studies on inhaled or plant-based cannabis, or of CBD-based products that do not contain THC.

### Depression

Although patients frequently report use of cannabis for depression, there is no clinical evidence to support its efficacy (Azcarate et al, 2020; Sarris et al, 2020). Furthermore, there is evidence that even a single dose of THC can elicit negative psychiatric effects in otherwise healthy patients (Hindley et al, 2020). There is also a known comorbidity between cannabis use disorder and both major depression and anxiety, which limits clinical recommendation for these conditions (Onaemo et al, 2021).

### Epilepsy

Epilepsy is challenging to treat, with medications often causing significant adverse effects and up to one-third of patients not responding fully to current antiepileptic medications. In animal models, both THC and CBD were shown to prevent seizures (Devinsky et al, 2014). The benefits and potential harms of cannabis in treatment of pediatric epilepsy have been assessed in 35 studies, all using cannabis-based products as an adjunctive treatment to other medications (Elliott et al, 2020). In these studies, cannabidiol was shown to both reduce seizure frequency and increase treatment response (Elliott et al, 2020). Epidiolex ${ }^{\mathrm{TM}}$ was approved by the FDA in 2018 based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 516 patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome (FDA, 2018).

### Spasticity 

For moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis, Sativex ${ }^{\mathrm{TM}}$ (an oral mucosal spray with 1:1 ratio of CBC to THC) has approval in 21 countries in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. In Israel, Sativex has approval for spasticity, pain, and chronic pain. In the United States, Sativex ${ }^{\mathrm{TM}}$ has received investigational status by the FDA for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (GW Pharmaceuticals, 2022).

### Tourette Syndrome

A systematic review of four small placebo-controlled studies of THC in patients with Tourette syndrome found a slight improvement in tic symptoms in patients taking THC capsules (up to 10 mg per day) over a 12 -week period (Whiting et al, 2015). The Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana (2017) notes "there is limited evidence that THC capsules are an effective treatment" for Tourette symptoms (pp. 4-16). In addition to insufficient evidence of symptom reduction, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on eight trials found adverse effects in patients treated with THC, with or without CBD (Black et al, 2019).

### Sleep Disorders and Insomnia

Whiting et al (2015) reviewed two placebo-controlled studies with sleep as the primary outcome, and 19 placebo-controlled studies for other indications where sleep was evaluated as one of the outcomes. The meta-analysis indicated greater improvements with cannabinoids in sleep quality among eight trials (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.58, $95 \% \mathrm{CI}=-0.87$ to -0.29 ) and sleep disturbance among three trials (WMD -0.26, $95 \% \mathrm{CI}=-0.52$ to 0.00 ). The Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana (2017) determined there is moderate evidence that cannabinoids are an effective treatment to improve short-term sleep outcomes in those with sleep disturbance, particularly associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, insomnia was often a secondary rather than primary outcome of cannabis studies and as such, bias and lack of rigor in trial design limits application of existing studies to clinical practice (Bhagavan et al, 2020).

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

There has been one fair-quality double-blind randomized crossover trial of nabilone in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-associated nightmares (Jetly et al, 2015). Nightmares, global clinical state, and general wellbeing were improved more with nabilone ( $0.5-3 \mathrm{mg}$ daily) treatment compared with placebo ( $p<0.05$ ), with no effect on sleep quality and quantity. One double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial using smoked cannabis compared high THC, balanced THC/CBD, and high CBD cannabis for PTSD symptom improvement in military veterans (Bonn-Miller et al, 2021). None of the active treatment arms was superior to placebo in this short-term trial. There are additional studies in progress examining the different types of cannabis with varying THC and CBD content on PTSD symptoms.

## Adverse Effects of Cannabis

In multiple systematic reviews, patients who received cannabis-based treatments reported higher overall risk for short-term adverse effects compared with control (Nugent et al, 2017; Whiting et al, 2015). Common adverse effects include xerostomia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, ataxia, vertigo/dizziness, and somnolence. The most common adverse effects reported during placebo-controlled clinical trials for nabilone were vertigo ( $52 \%$ ), drowsiness ( $52 \%$ ), dry mouth ( $36 \%$ ), ataxia ( $14 \%$ ), euphoria ( $11 \%$ ), sleep disturbance ( $11 \%$ ), dysphoria ( $9 \%$ ), and headache ( $6 \%$ ). Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome has been identified in persons who smoke cannabis daily for several years (Schreck et al, 2018).

### Reproductive Effects of Cannabis

Cannabis is the most frequently used drug among women of childbearing age. There is substantial evidence from a systematic review for a statistical association between maternal cannabis use and lower-birth-weight newborns (Gunn et al., 2016). Similar to cigarette smoking, maternal carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin levels are elevated when smoking cannabis, affecting fetal growth (Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Although cannabis can be present in breast milk, there is inconclusive evidence regarding the risk of exposure to infants due to lack of controlled studies (Ordean & Kim, 2020).

### Cancers

There is no evidence for increased lung, head, and neck cancers in those who smoke cannabis (Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). In a systematic review and meta-analysis of three case-control studies totaling 2,138 participants (719 cases and 1,419 controls) on the association between cannabis use and testicular germ cell tumors, participants who reported ever smoking cannabis had a statistically insignificant increased risk of developing testicular germ cell tumors (OR 1.19, 95% CI = 0.72–1.95; Gurney et al., 2015).

### Cognitive and Psychosocial Effects

There is clear evidence that recent (past 24 hours) cannabis use impairs cognitive performance, including learning, memory, and attention (Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Evidence for ongoing impairment of cognitive function after stopping cannabis use has been seen in a few studies. Of more concern is the effect of cannabis on the developing adolescent brain, with "cannabis use during adolescence related to impairments in subsequent academic achievement and education, employment and income, and social relationships and social roles" (Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017, p. 267).

### Mental Health Effects

The evidence for the effect of cannabis use on mental health is difficult to determine due to the complexity of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders. The Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2017) considered multiple systematic reviews before concluding that cannabis use does not appear to increase the likelihood of developing depression, anxiety, or PTSD, but cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia or other psychosis (the higher the use, the higher the risk). Likewise, patients with bipolar disorder who use cannabis daily have more bipolar symptoms, and heavy cannabis users report more suicidal thoughts than nonusers. The label for dronabinol (Marinol) includes a warning that it may exacerbate mania, depression, or schizophrenia, and patients should be screened for psychiatric history and avoid use.

## Summary

Cannabis use for recreational and medicinal purposes has increased significantly over the past decade. Numerous studies have documented benefit, particularly for those with epilepsy, insomnia, and chemotherapeutic-induced nausea. Many patients use this product in combination with other medications. Health-care providers must be well versed in the therapeutic uses of this increasingly popular medicine, its drug interactions, and the benefits and risks of short- and long-term use (Box 9-1).
