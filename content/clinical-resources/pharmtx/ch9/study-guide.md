# Study Guide: Chapter 9 - Cannabis for the Nurse Practitioner

This guide focuses on the key testable concepts, clinical applications, and safety considerations for cannabinoid-based therapeutics as presented in the source material.

### **1. Foundational Concepts & Legal Status**

- **Historical Use**: Cannabis was used medicinally as early as 2,000 BCE and was listed in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in 1851 as an analgesic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant.
- **Legal Status**: Prohibition began in 1937, and it is currently a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act.
- **Modern Accessibility**: As of 2022, 37 states and four territories have legalized medicinal cannabis, with a smaller number also permitting recreational use.

### **2. The Endocannabinoid System (ECS)**

A core understanding of the ECS is crucial for grasping how cannabinoids work.

- **Components**: The ECS consists of endocannabinoids (like anandamide), cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), and enzymes.
- **CB1 Receptors**:
    - **Location**: Primarily in the central nervous system (basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, neocortex, hypothalamus).
    - **Function**: Mediate motor activity, coordination, short-term memory, thinking, appetite, and sedation. Stimulation is psychoactive.
- **CB2 Receptors**:
    - **Location**: Found on immune cells, tissues, the spinal column, bone marrow, and the brain.
    - **Function**: Expressed during inflammatory and neurogenic conditions. They are a therapeutic target for pain and neurodegenerative illness. **Stimulation is not psychoactive**.

### **3. Key Cannabinoids**

- **Phytochemicals**: The cannabis plant contains up to 400 phytochemicals and 104 cannabinoids.
- **Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)**: The primary cannabinoid with psychoactive properties.
- **Cannabidiol (CBD)**: A cannabinoid with no psychotropic effects.
- ***Indica* vs. *Sativa***: Due to extensive interbreeding and hybridization, these distinctions are now considered "almost meaningless".

### **4. Pharmacokinetics: Route of Administration Matters**

| **Route** | **Onset of Action** | **Peak Blood Levels** | **Duration of Effects** | **Key Considerations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Inhaled (Smoked)** | Within minutes | ~30 minutes | 1 to 3.5 hours | Vaporizing may produce higher THC blood concentrations than smoking. |
| **Oral (Ingested)** | 30 mins to 2 hours | Varies | 5 to 8+ hours | Subject to first-pass metabolism in the liver, converting THC to the long-acting active metabolite 11-OH-THC. |
| **Oral Mucosal (Sativex™)** | Tmax: 2.4 hrs (THC), 2.8 hrs (CBD) | Varies | Varies | Bypasses some first-pass metabolism. |
| **Topical/Transdermal** | N/A | N/A | N/A | Minimal scientific information is available on the pharmacokinetics. |

### **5. FDA-Approved Cannabinoid Medications**

This is a high-yield topic for board exams and clinical practice.

- **Dronabinol (Marinol™, Syndros™)**:
    - **Description**: A synthetic THC product and Schedule III controlled substance.
    - **Approved Uses**: Anorexia associated with AIDS and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).
- **Nabilone (Cesamet™)**:
    - **Description**: A synthetic cannabinoid THC analogue and Schedule II controlled substance.
    - **Approved Use**: CINV in patients who have failed conventional treatments.
- **Epidiolex™**:
    - **Description**: A concentrated CBD oil.
    - **Approved Uses**: Seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
- **Nabiximols (Sativex™)**:
    - **Description**: An oral mucosal spray with a 1:1 ratio of THC to CBD.
    - **Status**: Approved in over 30 countries for spasticity in multiple sclerosis but remains investigational in the United States.

### **6. Clinical Applications & Strength of Evidence**

| **Condition** | **Evidence Summary** | **Key Points** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chronic Pain** | **Substantial Evidence** | Most common reason for medical use. Effective for chronic pain in adults, particularly neuropathic pain, which requires the THC component. |
| **CINV** | **Conclusive Evidence** (for oral cannabinoids) | Oral cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone) are as effective as standard antiemetics. No studies on inhaled or CBD-only products for this use. |
| **Epilepsy** | **Strong Evidence** (for CBD) | CBD has been shown to reduce seizure frequency. Epidiolex™ is FDA-approved based on robust clinical trials. |
| **MS Spasticity** | **Strong Evidence** (for Nabiximols) | Nabiximols (Sativex™) is approved for this indication in numerous countries. |
| **Sleep Disorders** | **Moderate Evidence** | Cannabinoids can improve short-term sleep outcomes, especially when sleep disturbance is associated with chronic pain, MS, or sleep apnea. |
| **Tourette Syndrome** | **Limited Evidence** | Small studies of THC capsules showed a slight improvement in tics but also adverse effects. |
| **Anxiety** | **Limited/Inconclusive Evidence** | CBD alone has shown modest effectiveness for social anxiety disorder. THC trials have been inconclusive. |
| **PTSD** | **Developing/Mixed Evidence** | One trial found nabilone improved PTSD-associated nightmares. A trial with smoked cannabis was not superior to placebo. |
| **Anorexia/Appetite** | **Insufficient Evidence** | Not enough evidence to recommend for wasting in HIV/AIDS or cancer-related anorexia. |
| **Cancer Treatment** | **Insufficient Evidence** | There is not enough evidence to support or refute the claim that cannabinoids are an effective treatment for cancer. |
| **Depression** | **No Clinical Evidence** | No evidence supports its efficacy. There is a known comorbidity between cannabis use disorder and major depression. |

### **7. Adverse Effects & Patient Counseling**

- **Common Short-Term Effects**: Drowsiness, dizziness/vertigo, ataxia (impaired coordination), xerostomia (dry mouth), nausea, and somnolence are frequently reported.
- **Cognitive Effects**: Recent cannabis use (past 24 hours) clearly impairs learning, memory, and attention. This is a major concern for the developing adolescent brain.
- **Mental Health Effects**:
    - **Psychosis**: Cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia or other psychoses.
    - **Bipolar Disorder**: Daily cannabis use may lead to more bipolar symptoms.
    - **Pre-existing Conditions**: The dronabinol label warns that it may exacerbate mania, depression, or schizophrenia; screen patients for psychiatric history before prescribing.
- **Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome**: A condition identified in individuals who smoke cannabis daily for several years.
- **Special Populations**:
    - **Pregnancy**: There is substantial evidence linking maternal cannabis smoking to lower birth weight in newborns.
    - **Lactation**: Cannabis can be present in breast milk, but the risk to infants is inconclusive due to a lack of studies.
