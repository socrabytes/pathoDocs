### Summary
*Today, more than ever, third-party payers, health-care providers, government regulators, and patients are demanding that new drug treatments be not only clinically more effective than their predecessors but also cost-effective. Angiography, stent placement, transplantation, and use of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of common conditions such as asthma have become relatively routine. After transplantation, patients who were previously dialysis-dependent are restored to relatively normal lives, with prolonged life expectancy and the ability to meaningfully contribute to society. None of these accomplishments come without economic cost to the patient or society.
Pharmacoeconomics provides a framework for evaluating drug treatments in terms of comparing the efficacy of one treatment with another and determining whether the treatment provides "value for the money" spent (Hay, 2008). Pharmacoeconomic evaluations of medical and surgical procedures seldom take into account factors other than the actual cost to the health-care system of the various pharmaceutical agents or surgical procedures (Berger \& Teutsch, 2005; Tunis, 2009). This approach underestimates the real cost of drug treatment, which depends on adherence, efficacy of therapeutic agents, hospitalizations, treatment for adverse drug reactions, and finally, life productivity and societal contributions. Also, a disturbing trend in modern medicine is the achievement of excellent short-term benefits that have relatively little long-term impact on comorbid conditions, drug toxicities, or patient nonadherence to the drug regimen. The introduction of similar drugs developed by multiple drug companies and the number of highly promoted drugs can also distort the facts about the actual cost of drug therapy.
Prescription drug spending has increased substantially in the past two decades. In 2020, pharmaceutical expenditures rose by $4.9 \%$ from 2019, totaling 535.5 billion (Tichy, 2021). Health-care organizations and pharmacy benefits managers have tried to control drug costs by using generic drugs and strict formularies. In 2021, generic drug sales accounted for $90 \%$ of all prescription drugs dispensed (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [U.S. FDA], 2022a). Although generic drugs have a place in health care, the decision to use them should be based on reasons beyond cost-cutting. However, with today's costconsciousness in health-care delivery, quality of care may be compromised in exchange for lower cost. Health care has become more like a business with a focus on the bottom line, but medicine cannot be just a business. Now, more than at any time in history, we are responsible for distinguishing between excellent care and inappropriate cost-cutting. Factors that influence pharmacoeconomics are found in Box 10-1.*

## Pharmacoeconomic Studies

Pharmacoeconomic studies were originally designed to research the cost of drug therapy to the health-care system. Clinical studies evaluate the safety and efficacy of a drug therapy, whereas pharmacoeconomic studies investigate the dollar value of patient care. Pharmacoeconomic studies are an increasing trend in all fields of health care. Unfortunately, most pharmacoeconomic drug studies have focused solely on economic outcomes, with little attention paid to clinical efficacy, safety, and humanistic outcomes. All health-care providers must understand the limitations of these pharmacoeconomic studies.

The criteria routinely used in the study of pharmacoeconomics include cost minimization, cost-benefit, and costeffectiveness. The information obtained from a well-designed, on-site (local) pharmacoeconomic study should include several components (Table 10-1), with the goal of helping health-care providers make important decisions regarding which protocol, treatment, services, and drugs should be used.

### Components of Well-Designed Studies

Pharmacoeconomics is the analysis of the costs and consequences of any given health-care-related treatment or service. Pharmacoeconomic analysis may involve several studies, each performed to answer different and specific types of questions. For any given analysis, knowing the point of view-whether a third-party payer, hospital, or government is determining the cost to society-is critical. Along with point of view, one should have a good understanding of the various types of costs and which are included in each type of analysis.

Direct costs are those that can be directly attributed to the treatment or disease state in question. They can include factors such as the acquisition price of medications, health-care provider time, or the cost of diagnostic tests. Direct, nonmedical costs must also be considered. This includes transportation to the medical facility or child-care expenses incurred while receiving treatments. Direct costs can further be divided into fixed and variable costs, but because fixed costs are usually associated with overhead and are not influenced by the treatment or disease state, they are often excluded in a pharmacoeconomic analysis.

Besides direct costs, indirect costs associated with the therapy must be considered in an analysis. These costs derive from morbidity and mortality and include things such as loss or reduction of wages owing to illness or the costs associated with premature death.

Indirect costs can be calculated by two methods, each with inherent flaws. The human capital method assumes losses based on an individual's capacity to earn money and is therefore skewed against older adults, homeless people, and unemployed people. The second method is the willingness-to-pay method. In this method, the patient is asked how much money they would be willing to spend to reduce the likelihood of a particular illness. This method tends to have a wide range of answers and is often not realistic.

Intangible costs are difficult to measure. They are related to nonfinancial outcomes and are hard to express monetarily. Included here are things such as inconvenience, pain and suffering, and grief. These costs are included in the willingness-topay calculation, but not the human capital calculation.

### Cost-of-Illness Analysis 

Cost of illness identifies the costs of a specific disease in a given population. It is a good baseline number when looking at different treatment or prevention strategies. The total for the cost-of-illness evaluation includes the cost for the medical resources used to treat the specified illness, the cost of nonmedical resources, and the loss of productivity by the patient. Intangible costs, such as pain and suffering, are difficult to quantify and thus are not included in this calculation. For many disease states, including diabetes and certain cancers, the cost-of-illness number has already been calculated. According to the American Diabetes Association (2018), the cost of diabetes in the United States was estimated at $\$ 327$ billion 2018, up from $\$ 245$ billion in 2012, a $26 \%$ increase in 5 years. This $\$ 327$ billion represents $\$ 237$ billion in direct health-care costs and $\$ 90$ billion in indirect costs due to lost productivity. (Note: This is strictly an estimate of economic burden and does not distinguish among treatment options.)

### Cost-Minimization Analysis

Cost-minimization analysis is straightforward. It looks at two or more treatment alternatives that are considered equal in efficacy and compares the cost of each alternative in dollars. It assumes that evidence supporting the efficacy of each alternative already exists and strictly looks at which would be the least costly to administer. An example of this is a comparison between two or more generic medications in the same therapeutic class for treatment of the same condition. (Note: The costs are not just related to acquisition of the product but include costs for any preparation, administration, or monitoring needed.) A comparison of heparin and its counterpart, the low molecular weight enoxaparin, is a good example. Heparin is inexpensive, but patients receiving it have associated laboratory costs, technician time, and pharmacist dosage adjustments that must be figured into the cost. Although enoxaparin is more expensive to acquire, the lack of need for laboratory monitoring may help bring the overall cost of enoxaparin down to about equal that of heparin. Therefore, costminimization analysis applied to pharmaceuticals reveals that generics are not necessarily always the least-costly alternative.

#### Table 10-1 Commonly Used Pharmacoeconomic Research Methodologies

| Method | Outcome | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Cost-minimization | Outcome must be clinically identical in similar <br> patient population <br> All social costs should be considered | Adalat CC vs. Procardia XL <br> Generic azathioprine vs. brand-name azathioprine |
| Cost-effectiveness | Different clinical outcome <br> Justify the incremental cost increase for the <br> therapeutic benefit from extra costs associated <br> with treatment | Antilymphocyte induction vs. no induction |
| Cost-benefit | Expressing clinical outcome purely in monetary <br> units <br> Assigns a dollar value to specific disease state <br> Unethical and should be avoided | 10 mm Hg reduction in blood pressure worth $\$ 100$ |

### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

Unlike cost-minimization analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis compares two or more treatments or programs that are not necessarily therapeutically equivalent. This type of analysis compares various treatment costs with a specific therapeutic outcome. The outcome is usually a nondollar unit, such as a mm Hg drop in blood pressure or number of cases cured. One of the following three conditions must be met for a treatment to be considered cost-effective: the alternative treatment may be less expensive and at least as effective as its comparator, it may be more expensive but provide an additional benefit worth the cost, or it may be less expensive and less effective in a situation in which the extra benefit is not worth the extra cost.

This method aims to find and promote the most efficient therapy for the given problem and find the best health care for each dollar spent. An example of this type of analysis is a comparison of two regimens for treating hypertension. Regimen A might consist of three medications that decrease systolic blood pressure by an average of 35 points. Regimen B, consisting of two medications that cost significantly less per month than regimen A, lowers systolic blood pressure by 20 points. To determine which is more cost-effective, the analysis team must decide whether the extra drop in blood pressure is worth the added cost of regimen A.

For example, one cost-effectiveness model for long-acting risperidone examined the cost of the longer-acting formula versus increased compliance with a simpler dosing schedule, factoring in the economic implications of poorly managed schizophrenia (Haycox, 2005). Another example is a comparison of the costs of colchicine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of gout, where the monthly cost of colchicine is much higher than NSAIDs (Wertheimer et al, 2011). When the total cost of treatment, including treating gastrointestinal complications in a patient taking NSAIDs, is calculated, colchicine is more cost-effective (Wertheimer et al, 2011).

### Cost-Benefit Analysis 

In cost-benefit analysis (CBA), the costs of a specific treatment or intervention are calculated and then compared with the dollar value of the benefit received. One way to think about this analysis is whether a given benefit will exceed the cost needed to implement it. Many CBAs will look at two separate interventions or programs and determine which produces a greater benefit for the money. The two benefits may or may not be similar. The results of a CBA can be described in two formats. The first is a ratio and the second is the dollar difference between the two. If a specific treatment is valued at $\$ 5,000$ and the benefit is determined to be $\$ 50,000$, one could determine that the cost-benefit ratio was 10:1 (benefit divided by cost) or the benefit of this specific treatment is $\$ 45,000$ (benefit minus cost). The net benefit (or cost) is more commonly used than a ratio because a 10:1 ratio could imply numbers with vastly different benefits (i.e., $\$ 1,000,000$ to $\$ 100,000$ vs. $\$ 40$ to $\$ 4$ ).

One of the challenges of this type of analysis is that the benefits are often perceived; thus, it is difficult to quantify them. A common use of CBA is for budgeting purposes. A pharmacy can determine whether an existing anticoagulation program is worth keeping or whether that money would be better spent on a new hypertension clinic or diabetes education program.

### Cost-Utility Analysis

In cost-utility analysis, the costs of the treatment choice are in dollars and the outcomes are expressed in terms of patient preference or quality-adjusted life years (QALY). A full year at full health is considered 1 QALY, whereas various diseases and their treatments produce a lower number (0.01-0.99). These QALY values are subjective, and agreement on a scale to measure utility is lacking. The best use for this analysis is when quality of life is the most important factor to be considered. The analysis is commonly used in situations in which the treatment option can be life-extending but have significant side effects. Cancer treatment options are often reviewed with cost-utility analysis. A chemotherapy treatment regimen, for example, may bring about a 6-month extension of life expectancy, but if the patient is too nauseated to get out of bed or eat, it may not be worth the extra 6 months.

## IMPACT OF GENERIC DRUGS ON DRUG THERAPY

Drug pricing in today's health-care system is complex. The goal is to reduce drug acquisition costs to the lowest possible amount without affecting quality of care. Most pharmacies can control acquisition costs by purchasing generic drugs. However, in some situations, brand-name drugs are less expensive than generic drug products owing to internal bidding, group purchasing, and negotiations with vendors. The costs of generic drugs and single-source brand-name drugs to pharmacies and patients differ and are driven by market-force competition for the limited pool of dollars.

Although most drugs are sold for $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ less than the average wholesale price (AWP) and prices vary widely, AWP is routinely used for comparing different agents. A common method for determining reimbursement and controlling health-care system costs used by the federal Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and private payers is the maximum allowable cost (MAC). Although drug pricing is complex, most pharmacy benefits groups are still businesses that seek profits. According to the MAC list prices, most pharmacy benefits groups select a drug with the lowest acquisition cost regardless of generic or brand-name status to reduce the cost of drug therapy. In most cases, pharmacy benefits groups pass this cost savings on to the patients by means of substantially lower co-payments for generic drugs.
Many benefit plans have tiered benefits, in which the patient pays a greater co-payment for brand-name drugs than for generic equivalent prescriptions. Most pharmacy benefits groups have maximum annual benefits for brand-name drugs ranging from $\$ 1,500$ to $\$ 2,000$ per year. The generic drug benefit is unlimited and the purchase of generic drugs will not count against the $\$ 2,000$ annual ceiling. For many generic drugs, the AWP is at least $50 \%$ of that of the brand-name drug. Therefore, in general, co-payments are usually $50 \%$ of the AWP for single-source brand-name drugs. Patients may also take advantage of the numerous prescription programs offered by many large retail pharmacies where they can get a month's supply of a generic drug for $\$ 4$ monthly or $\$ 10$ for 3 months and not have to be concerned about their prescription coverage.

Generic medications are available to treat the most common diseases seen in primary care, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and common infections; therefore, patients benefit from the prescription of generic equivalents. Lipitor, the number-one-selling drug in 2011, with sales of $\$ 7,668,425,000$, went off patent in November 2011, which has provided savings to consumers (Bartholow, 2012). The older generic statins are $\$ 0.05$ to $\$ 0.50$ per day, versus $\$ 14,000$ a year for newer on-patent cholesterol-lowering medications alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha; Aitken \& Kleinrock, 2017). The availability of less costly generic drug alternatives for expensive agents would ease financial burdens for most patients, enabling them to comply with their treatments. Increased compliance may decrease health-care utilization in these patients, allowing greater access to health care for other patients. In addition, most patients can easily be stabilized on a generic drug product with a narrow therapeutic index, as well as on an innovator brand.

### Generic Substitution 

As health-care system costs continue to escalate, accountability in health-care spending and patient outcomes as a measure of effectiveness of health-care delivery has become crucial. Decreasing the total cost of drug therapy while improving outcomes has become a challenging responsibility for health-care providers. Today, generic substitution for brand-name drugs is a common practice in most health-care organizations to decrease the total cost of pharmacotherapy. In 2021, generic drugs accounted for $90 \%$ of all drug sales (U.S. FDA, 2022b).

Although generic drug substitution has become commonplace, there are still concerns among health-care providers, payers, and patients regarding giving up quality for cost. Health-care providers are under pressure from both innovator companies and payers. Innovator companies that have supported the field of medicine through educational grants and clinical drug studies apply subtle pressure on health-care providers to continue to prescribe brand-name drugs only. The critical issue in using generic drugs involves justifying conversion from a brand-name drug to a generic agent in stable patients or using the drug de novo in terms of safety, efficacy, and economics. To help address this issue, the generic bioequivalence standards and different methods of studying pharmacoeconomics should be considered.

### Generic Bioequivalence

The U.S. FDA regulates the manufacture of generic drugs by setting rigorous standards for bioequivalence and is responsible for protecting patients and assuring prescribers that generic drug products truly are "equivalent" to those of the innovator pharmaceutical companies. To gain FDA approval, a generic drug must do all of the following (U.S. FDA, 2014):

- Contain the same active ingredients as the innovator drug. Active ingredients make the drug effective against the disease or condition it is treating.
- Come in the same dosage form. If the brand name is a capsule, the generic should also be a capsule.
- Be administered in the same way. If the brand name is taken orally, the generic should also be taken orally.
- Be identical in strength.
- Have the same conditions of use.
- Be bioequivalent (an equal rate and extent of drug absorbed in the bloodstream).
- Meet the same standards for identity, strength, purity, and quality.
- Be manufactured under the same standards that the FDA requires for the manufacture of innovator products.

The FDA monitors complaints regarding generics. In the case of Budeprion XL 300 mg , a generic form of Wellbutrin XL, after years of patient complaints, the FDA conducted studies that determined Budeprion XL 300 was not bioequivalent to Wellbutrin XL 300 (U.S. FDA, 2014). These strict standards for generic medications ensure the availability of safe generic equivalents for the public.

==Pharmaceutical Equivalents==
Drug products are considered pharmaceutical equivalents when both agents contain identical amounts of active ingredients in the same salt or ester form, dosage form, and route of administration and possess identical disintegration times and dissolution rates.

==Therapeutic Equivalents==
Drug products are considered therapeutically equivalent when the generic drugs are pharmaceutical equivalents and show the same efficacy and safety profile as the product whose efficacy and safety have been established.

==Bioequivalence==
Bioequivalence is defined as pharmaceutical equivalents that display the same rate and extent of absorption. Biological equivalence means delivering the same amount of active drug moiety to the site of action when generic and innovator drugs are administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions. Only drug products that are therapeutically equivalent to drugs already FDA-approved are safe and should be considered for generic substitution in most patients.

## APPLYING PHARMACOECONOMICS TO PRACTICE

Prescription of generic drugs versus brand-name drugs is discussed in this section, using clinical examples of and rationales for generic substitution. An explanation of Medicare Part D will demonstrate why prescribers need to be familiar with their patients' prescription drug coverage, because it may affect compliance.

### Prescribing Generic Versus Brand-Name Medications 

Generic drugs that are considered therapeutic equivalents may be exchanged for brand-name drugs with confidence. Pharmacists may substitute a generic equivalent for a brand-name drug unless the prescriber specifies "Dispense as Written" on the prescription. Shrank et al (2011) studied 5.6 million prescriptions written for 2 million patients and found there was a greater chance that the prescription was not filled if "Dispense as Written" was on the prescription or requested by the patient. It is critical to discuss pharmacy benefit coverage with the patient before prescribing a drug as "Dispense as Written."

Many retail stores offer prescription programs in which a select list of generic drugs are offered for $\$ 4$ for a 30-day supply and $\$ 10$ for a 90-day supply. This may be a substantial savings for patients, especially those without prescription drug coverage or with a high co-payment for their medications. For example, generic metformin 500 mg tablets are $\$ 4$ for a 30-day supply, whereas the retail price for the brand-name Glucophage is $\$ 70$ for the same 30-day supply. The caveat is that the patient must live nearby or have transportation to one of the retail pharmacies that have retail drug programs, such as Walgreens, Walmart, Target, and Kroger stores.

### Medicare Part D

In 2004, Congress added a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program called Medicare Part D. Part D was enacted to assist seniors with the high cost of their medications, but the implementation has been confusing for many. When initially passed, Part D covered only a portion of prescription drug costs, leaving a significant proportion to the patient, often referred to as the "donut hole" point of coverage. The Affordable Care Act gradually narrowed the gap and has decreased the amount paid by Medicare recipients in the "donut hole." In 2018, the gap was $\$ 3,750$ to $\$ 5,000$, and Medicare enrollees get a $65 \%$ discount on brand-name drugs and $56 \%$ on generic drug costs during the gap in the coverage period (Medicare.gov, 2022). In 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which limits the cost of insulin to $\$ 35.00$ per month beginning in 2023, and caps expenditures for medications to $\$ 2,000.00$ per year beginning in 2025 for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries.

Part D has increased the use of essential drugs such as statins, warfarin, and clopidogrel among older adults who did not have drug coverage before the prescription benefit plan was implemented (Schneeweiss et al, 2009). Schneeweiss et al (2009) noted a $5 \%$ decline in the proportion of patients filling their clopidogrel prescription when patient drug costs reached the coverage gap. Similarly, a $4.8 \%$ decline in warfarin and a $6.3 \%$ decline in statin prescription refills were noted (Schneeweiss et al, 2009). Duru et al (2010) examined cost-related noncompliance among diabetics covered by Part D and found noncompliance among beneficiaries using insulin increased when their benefits during the gap did not have generic drug coverage. Providers must work with patients to determine whether less expensive but equally effective prescriptions can be used to prevent patients with limited means from reaching the point of having to pay the full amount for their prescriptions, as this may decrease compliance, increasing the overall cost of care due to poor outcomes.

## SUMMARY

Pharmacoeconomics is the study of the appropriate utilization of drugs for the treatment of a specific disease. Pharmacoeconomic studies characterize the improved outcomes while justifying additional drug expenditures. Because the value and economics of many approved drugs are unknown at the time of approval, the true impact of new drug substitution on the cost and care of most patients with complicated conditions is also unknown. In theory, if a therapeutically equivalent and less expensive product is available, it should be substituted. This may substantially affect the cost of drug therapy and overall health-care costs. Applying pharmacoeconomics to prescribing practice involves understanding the impact of drug costs on patients and making an educated prescribing decision to ensure the best outcome.
